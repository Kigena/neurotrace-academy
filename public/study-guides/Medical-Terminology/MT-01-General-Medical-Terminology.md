## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### Medical Terminology Foundation
- **Medical terminology uses specific prefixes, suffixes, and root words**
- Understanding these components helps decode complex terms
- Many terms have opposite pairs that are commonly confused
- Exam questions often test discrimination between similar terms

### Key Principle
- **Precise terminology prevents medical errors and ensures accurate communication**

## 2. Critical Term Pairs (High-Yield Exam Traps)

### Iatrogenic vs Idiopathic

#### Iatrogenic
- **Definition:** Disease, disorder, or medical condition that is the direct result of medical treatment
- **Root:** "Iatro-" = physician/treatment
- **Examples:**
  - Medication side effects
  - Surgical complications
  - Hospital-acquired infections
- **Key Point:** Has a known cause (treatment)

#### Idiopathic
- **Definition:** Condition that occurs with no known cause
- **Root:** "Idio-" = unknown/peculiar
- **Examples:**
  - Idiopathic epilepsy
  - Idiopathic neuropathy
- **Key Point:** Unknown cause

**🔑 Exam Trap:** These are OPPOSITE concepts - one has known cause (treatment), other has unknown cause

### Acute vs Chronic

#### Acute

#### Chronic
- **Definition:** Condition that persists over a long period
- **Characteristics:**
  - Gradual or persistent onset
  - Long duration
  - May be progressive
- **Examples:** Chronic pain, chronic disease

**🔑 Exam Trap:** Onset (sudden vs gradual) + duration (short vs long) are key distinctions

### Bilateral vs Unilateral

#### Bilateral
- **Definition:** Condition affecting both sides of the body or two paired organs
- **Examples:**
  - Bilateral hearing loss (both ears)
  - Bilateral pneumonia (both lungs)
- **Key Point:** Both sides

- **Distinction:**
  - **Urea:** Also kidney waste
  - **Bilirubin:** Liver waste

### In Situ
- **Definition:** Term meaning "in place" - used to describe a cancer that has not spread
- **Key Point:** Localized, no invasion or metastasis
- **Opposite:** Metastatic (spread)

### Adipose Tissue
- **Definition:** Another term for fatty tissue that stores energy, insulates and cushions the body
- **Functions:**
  - Energy storage
  - Insulation
  - Cushioning
- **Distinction:**
  - **Muscle tissue:** Contractile
  - **Connective tissue:** Structural

### Insomnia
- **Definition:** Difficulty falling and remaining asleep
- **Distinction:**
  - **Narcolepsy:** Excessive daytime sleepiness
  - **Sleep apnea:** Breathing cessation
  - **Hypersomnia:** Excessive sleep

### Debridement
- **Definition:** Surgical removal of dead, damaged or infected tissue or some foreign material from a wound or burn
- **Purpose:** Wound cleaning and healing promotion
- **Distinction:**
  - **Excision:** General removal
  - **Drainage:** Fluid removal

### Carcinogen
- **Definition:** Anything that can cause cancer
- **Distinction:**
  - **Mutagen:** Causes mutations (may or may not cause cancer)
  - **Teratogen:** Causes birth defects
  - **Oncogene:** Promotes cancer

### Febrile
- **Definition:** Related to fever
- **Opposite:** Afebrile (no fever)
- **Related:**
  - **Hyperthermic:** Elevated temperature
  - **Hypothermic:** Low temperature

### Adverse Reaction
- **Definition:** An unintended and unwanted side effect of some sort of treatment, usually drug therapy
- **Key Point:** Unintended harmful effect
- **Distinction:**
  - **Therapeutic effect:** Intended benefit
  - **Drug interaction:** Drug-drug effect

### Canal
- **Definition:** A tunnel-like passage in the body
- **Distinction:**
  - **Duct:** Usually glandular
  - **Fistula:** Abnormal connection

### Blood Pressure
- **Definition:** The tension in the main arteries created by the beating of the heart, resistance to flow, and elasticity of blood vessels
- **Components:**
  - Heart contraction
  - Vascular resistance
  - Vessel elasticity

## 5. ABRET Exam Pearls

### Critical Distinctions
1. **Iatrogenic vs Idiopathic:** One has known cause (treatment), other has unknown cause - these are OPPOSITE
2. **Acute vs Chronic:** Onset (sudden vs gradual) + duration (short vs long) are both key
3. **Bilateral vs Unilateral:** Number of sides affected is critical for accurate documentation
4. **Cyanosis vs Jaundice:** Color + cause - bluish (oxygen) vs yellow (bilirubin)

### Common Exam Traps
- Mixing iatrogenic and idiopathic (opposite concepts)
- Confusing acute with chronic based on severity alone (must consider onset + duration)
- Using "bilateral" when only one side is affected
- Confusing cyanosis (oxygen) with jaundice (liver)

---

## 6. Practice Application

### Clinical Scenarios
1. **A patient develops a rash after starting a new medication.**
   - This is **iatrogenic** (treatment-caused)

2. **A patient has epilepsy with no known cause.**
   - This is **idiopathic** (unknown cause)

3. **A patient's symptoms began suddenly 2 days ago.**
   - This is **acute** (sudden onset, short duration)

4. **A patient has had symptoms for 6 months.**
   - This is **chronic** (long duration)

5. **A patient has hearing loss in both ears.**
   - This is **bilateral** (both sides)

---

## 7. Quick Reference Summary

### Must-Know Definitions
- **Iatrogenic:** Treatment-caused
- **Idiopathic:** Unknown cause
- **Acute:** Sudden + short
- **Chronic:** Persistent + long
- **Bilateral:** Both sides
- **Cyanosis:** Bluish (low oxygen)
- **Atrophy:** Tissue shrinkage
- **Abscess:** Localized pus
- **In situ:** Localized (no spread)
- **Febrile:** Fever-related

### Memory Anchors
- "Iatro-" = physician/treatment → iatrogenic
- "Idio-" = unknown → idiopathic
- Acute = sudden + short (think "acute angle" = sharp/sudden)
- Chronic = long (think "chronicle" = long story)
- Bilateral = bi (two) + lateral (side)

---

**Next Steps:**
- Review discrimination pairs daily
- Practice with clinical scenarios
- Focus on opposite concepts (iatrogenic/idiopathic, acute/chronic)
- Use memory anchors for quick recall
