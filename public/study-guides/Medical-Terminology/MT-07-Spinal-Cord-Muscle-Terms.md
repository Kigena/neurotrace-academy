**Style:** Definition-based, exam-oriented, suffix-focused

## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### Suffix Recognition
- **"-itis" = inflammation**
- **"-pathy" = disease (general)**
- **"-oma" = tumor**
- **"-osis" = condition/process**

### Key Principle
- **Suffixes indicate mechanism (inflammation vs disease vs tumor)**

---

## 2. Muscle Terms

### Myositis

- **Definition:** Generic term for muscle inflammation causing pain and weakness
- **Suffix:** "-itis" = inflammation
- **Features:**
  - Muscle inflammation
  - Pain and weakness
  - Elevated inflammatory markers
- **🔑 Key:** "-itis" suffix = inflammation

---

### Myopathy

- **Definition:** Generic term for a disease of the muscle that usually results in deterioration of the muscle
- **Suffix:** "-pathy" = disease (general)
- **Features:**
  - General muscle disease
  - May or may not be inflammatory
  - Broader term than myositis
- **🔑 Key:** "-pathy" = general disease (broader than "-itis")

**🔑 Exam Trap:** Myositis = inflammation (specific). Myopathy = general disease (broader, may or may not be inflammatory)

---

## 3. Spinal Cord Terms

### Myelitis

- **Definition:** Inflammation of the spinal cord which can cause headaches, fever, muscle stiffness, pain, weakness and eventually paralysis
- **Suffix:** "-itis" = inflammation
- **Location:** Spinal cord
- **Features:**
  - Spinal cord inflammation
  - Can cause paralysis
- **🔑 Key:** Spinal cord + "-itis" = myelitis

---

### Myelopathy

- **Definition:** General term for spinal cord disease
- **Suffix:** "-pathy" = disease (general)
- **Location:** Spinal cord
- **Features:**
  - Broader than myelitis
  - May or may not be inflammatory
- **🔑 Key:** Spinal cord + "-pathy" = myelopathy (broader)

**🔑 Exam Trap:** Myelitis = inflammation (specific). Myelopathy = general disease (broader)

---

### Myelomeningocele

- **Definition:** Protrusion of the spinal cord and its coverings (meninges) out from the spine, one of the more severe forms of spina bifida
- **Components:**
  - Spinal cord
  - Meninges
- **Severity:** Most severe form of spina bifida
- **🔑 Key:** Cord + meninges = myelomeningocele (most severe)

---

### Myelofibrosis

- **Definition:** Build up of fibrous connective tissue in the bone marrow affecting the production of blood components
- **Location:** Bone marrow (NOT spinal cord)
- **Effect:** Affects hematopoiesis (blood cell production)
- **🔑 Key:** Bone marrow + fibrosis = myelofibrosis

**🔑 Exam Trap:** "Myelo-" can mean spinal cord OR bone marrow - context matters

---

## 4. Nerve Terms

### Motor Nerve

- **Definition:** A nerve that carries messages to a muscle that cause the muscle to move
- **Type:** Efferent (carrying signals away from CNS to muscles)
- **Function:** Causes muscle movement
- **🔑 Key:** Efferent + muscle movement = motor nerve

---

### Multiple Sclerosis

- **Definition:** A disease in which the protective coverings of nerve fibers in the brain are gradually destroyed with symptoms of numbness to paralysis and loss of control of bodily function
- **Location:** Central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)
- **Mechanism:** Demyelination
- **Features:**
  - CNS demyelination
  - Relapsing-remitting course
  - Multiple symptoms
- **EEG:** May show diffuse slowing during exacerbations
- **🔑 Key:** CNS + demyelination = multiple sclerosis

**🔑 Exam Trap:** CNS (not peripheral) distinguishes from Guillain-Barré

---

## 5. Bone Marrow Terms

### Multiple Myeloma

- **Definition:** A cancer affecting cells in the bone marrow
- **Type:** Malignant plasma cells
- **Location:** Bone marrow
- **🔑 Key:** Bone marrow + plasma cells + malignant = multiple myeloma

**🔑 Exam Trap:** "Myelo-" here means bone marrow (not spinal cord)

## 6. High-Yield Exam Discrimination Table

| Term | Suffix | Location | Mechanism |
|------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Myositis | -itis | Muscle | Inflammation |
| Myopathy | -pathy | Muscle | General disease |
| Myelitis | -itis | Spinal cord | Inflammation |
| Myelopathy | -pathy | Spinal cord | General disease |
| Myelofibrosis | -osis | Bone marrow | Fibrosis |
| Multiple myeloma | -oma | Bone marrow | Cancer |
| Multiple sclerosis | -osis | CNS | Demyelination |

## 7. ABRET Exam Pearls

### Critical Distinctions
1. **"-itis" vs "-pathy":** Inflammation (specific) vs general disease (broader)
2. **Myositis vs Myopathy:** Inflammation vs general muscle disease
3. **Myelitis vs Myelopathy:** Spinal cord inflammation vs general cord disease
4. **"Myelo-" context:** Can mean spinal cord OR bone marrow - check context

### Common Exam Traps
- Mixing "-itis" (inflammation) with "-pathy" (general disease)
- Confusing myositis (inflammation) with myopathy (general)
- Forgetting that "myelo-" can mean bone marrow (myelofibrosis, myeloma) or spinal cord (myelitis)
- Missing that multiple sclerosis is CNS (not peripheral)

---

## 8. Quick Reference Summary

### Must-Know Suffixes
- **"-itis"** = inflammation (specific)
- **"-pathy"** = disease (general, broader)
- **"-oma"** = tumor
- **"-osis"** = condition/process

### Must-Know Definitions
- **Myositis:** Muscle inflammation
- **Myopathy:** General muscle disease
- **Myelitis:** Spinal cord inflammation
- **Myelopathy:** General spinal cord disease
- **Motor nerve:** Efferent nerve to muscles
- **Multiple sclerosis:** CNS demyelination
- **Multiple myeloma:** Bone marrow cancer

### Memory Anchors
- "-itis" = inflammation (think "it is inflamed")
- "-pathy" = disease (think "pathology")
- Myelo- = check context (cord or marrow)
- Motor = movement (think "motor" = "moves")

**Next Steps:**
- Memorize suffix meanings
- Learn "-itis" vs "-pathy" distinction
- Understand "myelo-" context (cord vs marrow)
- Practice discrimination between similar terms
