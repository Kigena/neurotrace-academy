## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### Cranial Nerves
- **Numbered I-XII**
- **Each has specific function**
- **Sensory vs Motor vs Mixed**
- **Location determines function**

### Key Principle
- **Understanding cranial nerve functions enables accurate identification**

---

## 2. Cranial Nerves

### Olfactory Nerve (CN I)

- **Function:** Nerves involved in smell
- **Type:** Special sensory
- **Location:** Nose to brain
- **🔑 Key:** Smell = olfactory (CN I)

---

## 3. Peripheral Nerves

### Median Nerve

- **Location:** Runs down the arm to the hand
- **Functions:**
  - **Motor:** Controls muscle movement in forearm and hand
  - **Sensory:** Conveys sensation to part of the hand, thumb, and index finger
- **Type:** Mixed (motor + sensory)
- **🔑 Key:** Thumb + index finger = median nerve

**🔑 Exam Trap:** Median nerve = thumb + index finger (not pinky/ring finger - that's ulnar)

---

### Sciatic Nerve

- **Location:** Runs down the length of the leg to the foot
- **Function:** Motor and sensory to leg/foot
- **Disorder:** Sciatica (pain along sciatic nerve)
- **🔑 Key:** Leg distribution = sciatic nerve

---

## 4. Sensory Disorders

### Vertigo

- **Definition:** The feeling that one or one's surroundings are spinning
- **System:** Vestibular system
- **Causes:**
  - Inner ear disorders (Ménière's disease)
  - Brainstem disorders
  - Cerebellar disorders
- **Distinction:**
  - **Dizziness:** Broader term
  - **Vertigo:** Specific spinning sensation
- **🔑 Key:** Spinning sensation = vertigo

---

### Ménière's Disease

- **Definition:** A disorder of the inner ear, causing hearing loss, ringing in the ear, and sensation that one's surroundings are spinning
- **Classic triad:**
  1. Hearing loss
  2. Tinnitus (ringing)
  3. Vertigo (spinning)
- **Location:** Inner ear
- **🔑 Key:** Inner ear + triad = Ménière's disease

## 5. High-Yield Exam Discrimination Table

| Structure | Function | Key Feature |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Olfactory (CN I) | Smell | Special sensory |
| Median nerve | Motor + sensory | Thumb + index finger |
| Sciatic nerve | Motor + sensory | Leg distribution |
| Vertigo | Spinning sensation | Vestibular system |
| Ménière's | Inner ear disorder | Hearing + tinnitus + vertigo |

---

## 6. ABRET Exam Pearls

### Critical Distinctions
1. **Olfactory (CN I):** Smell - first cranial nerve
2. **Median nerve:** Thumb + index finger (not pinky/ring)
3. **Vertigo:** Spinning (not just dizziness)
4. **Ménière's:** Inner ear + classic triad

### Common Exam Traps
- Confusing median nerve distribution (thumb/index) with ulnar (pinky/ring)
- Mixing vertigo (spinning) with general dizziness
- Forgetting that olfactory is CN I (smell)

---

## 7. Quick Reference Summary

### Must-Know Definitions
- **Olfactory:** Smell (CN I)
- **Median nerve:** Arm to hand, thumb + index finger
- **Sciatic nerve:** Leg distribution
- **Vertigo:** Spinning sensation
- **Ménière's disease:** Inner ear + triad (hearing, tinnitus, vertigo)

### Memory Anchors
- Olfactory = smell (think "olfactory" = "olfactory")
- Median = middle (think "median" = middle fingers = thumb/index)
- Vertigo = spinning (think "vertigo" = "vert" = turn/spin)

---

**Next Steps:**
- Memorize cranial nerve functions
- Learn peripheral nerve distributions
- Understand sensory system disorders
- Practice discrimination between similar terms
