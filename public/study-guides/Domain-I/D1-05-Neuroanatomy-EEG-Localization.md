**Section:** Neuroanatomy for EEG Localization  
**Style:** Spatial, applied, ABRET-focused

---

## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### EEG Reflects Superficial Cortical Activity
- **EEG reflects superficial cortical activity:** Surface recording
- EEG records from cortical surface
- Deep structures are poorly represented
- Scalp EEG is surface-limited
- Must understand this limitation

### Localization Is Approximate, Not Exact
- **Localization is approximate, not exact:** Regional, not pinpoint
- EEG localizes to regions, not exact points
- Multiple electrodes may be involved
- Spread of activity is common
- Cannot pinpoint exact location

### Anatomy Must Be Interpreted Alongside EEG Patterns
- **Anatomy must be interpreted alongside EEG patterns:** Context matters
- EEG findings need anatomical context
- Clinical correlation is essential
- Patterns guide interpretation
- Cannot interpret in isolation

### Key Principle
- **EEG localization is regional, not anatomical pinpointing**
- Regional localization is the goal
- Exact anatomical pinpointing is not possible
- Must understand limitations
- Apply cautiously

### Practical Application
- Use regional terms (frontal, temporal, etc.)
- Avoid overprecise localization
- Understand EEG limitations
- Apply anatomy contextually

*Figure 1: Lateral view of the brain showing the four major lobes (Frontal, Parietal, Temporal, Occipital) and key functional areas.

## 4. EEG Electrodes → Cortical Regions

| EEG Electrode | Cortical Region |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Fp** | Prefrontal |
| **F** | Frontal |
| **C** | Central (motor/sensory) |
| **T** | Temporal |
| **P** | Parietal |
| **O** | Occipital |

### ABRET Emphasis
- **Temporal regions are critical for epilepsy localization**
- Temporal lobe epilepsy is common
- T electrodes are essential
- Temporal spikes are frequent
- Must know temporal anatomy

### Electrode Naming Logic
- **Electrode naming logic:** Systematic naming
- Letter = region (F, T, C, P, O)
- Number = side (odd = left, even = right)
- "z" = midline
- Systematic localization

### Best Practice
- Memorize electrode-to-region mapping
- Understand naming logic
- Apply to localization
- Know temporal importance

## 5. Limitations of EEG Localization

### Poor Sensitivity To

#### Deep Structures
- **Deep structures:** Not well represented
- Thalamus, basal ganglia, brainstem
- Deep structures produce minimal scalp EEG
- Cannot localize deep pathology
- Must understand limitation

#### Small Lesions
- **Small lesions:** May not be visible
- Small cortical lesions may not show
- Depends on size and location
- May require imaging
- EEG is not sensitive to all lesions

### Skull and Scalp Distort Signals
- **Skull and scalp distort signals:** Signal attenuation
- Skull attenuates signals
- Scalp spreads signals
- Distortion of localization
- Approximate localization only

### ABRET Trap
- **Normal EEG does not exclude deep pathology**
- Deep lesions may not show on EEG
- Normal EEG ≠ no pathology
- Must correlate clinically
- Cannot exclude deep pathology

### Best Practice
- Understand EEG limitations
- Know what EEG cannot detect
- Apply limitations to interpretation
- Correlate with clinical findings

## 6. Common ABRET Exam Traps

### Trap 1: Assuming EEG Can Localize Subcortical Lesions
- **Reality:** EEG localizes cortical surface activity
- **Trap:** May think EEG can localize deep structures
- **Solution:** Understand EEG limitations
- **ABRET focus:** EEG localization limitations

### Trap 2: Overinterpreting Single Electrode Abnormalities
- **Reality:** Single electrode findings may be artifact
- **Trap:** May overinterpret single electrode
- **Solution:** Require multiple electrodes or montage confirmation
- **ABRET focus:** Multi-electrode confirmation

### Trap 3: Confusing Electrode Name with Exact Anatomy
- **Reality:** Electrodes represent regions, not exact points
- **Trap:** May think electrode = exact anatomical location
- **Solution:** Understand regional localization
- **ABRET focus:** Regional vs exact localization

### Trap 4: Ignoring Montage Effects
- **Reality:** Montage affects localization appearance
- **Trap:** May not consider montage
- **Solution:** Always consider montage
- **ABRET focus:** Montage effects on localization

### Trap 5: Forgetting Functional Correlations
- **Reality:** Anatomy has functional implications
- **Trap:** May not consider function
- **Solution:** Link anatomy to function
- **ABRET focus:** Functional-anatomical correlation

## 7. Clinical Correlation

### EEG Findings Guide

#### Imaging Decisions
- **Imaging decisions:** When to image
- Focal findings may warrant imaging
- Localization guides imaging
- Structural vs functional
- Clinical correlation essential

#### Clinical Correlation
- **Clinical correlation:** Match findings to symptoms
- EEG findings must match clinical
- Localization must make sense
- Functional-anatomical correlation
- Clinical context is essential

### Localization Improves Diagnostic Confidence but Is Not Definitive
- **Localization improves diagnostic confidence but is not definitive**
- Good localization = higher confidence
- But not definitive
- Must correlate clinically
- Cannot diagnose from EEG alone

### Best Practice
- Use localization to guide decisions
- Correlate with clinical findings
- Understand limitations
- Apply cautiously

## 8. Case-Based Example

### Scenario
**Clinical Setting:** Routine EEG for seizure evaluation  
**EEG Finding:** Spikes at T5  
**Question:** What does this localize to?

### Interpretation
- **Left posterior temporal region**
- T5 = left temporal (odd number = left)
- Posterior temporal location
- Regional localization
- Functional implications

### Teaching Point
- **EEG localization is regional and functional**
- T5 = left posterior temporal region
- Not exact anatomical point
- Regional localization
- Functional correlation important

### ABRET Application
- Given electrode → identify region
- Given region → understand function
- Given finding → localize regionally
- Must know electrode-to-region mapping
