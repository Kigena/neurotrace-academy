## 2. Naming Conventions

### Letter = Brain Region

#### T = Temporal
- **T = Temporal:** Temporal lobe electrodes

- T7, T8: Alternative naming (same as T3, T4)
- Critical for epilepsy localization

#### C = Central
- **C = Central:** Central (Rolandic) region
- C3, C4: Central regions

### ABRET Emphasis
- **Temporal electrodes are critical for epilepsy localization**

## 4. Measurement Logic

### Distances Measured as Percentages

#### 10% and 20% Intervals
- **10% and 20% intervals:** Measurement basis
- 10%: Between adjacent electrodes
- 20%: Between major electrodes
- Based on skull dimensions
- Ensures proportional placement

### Reference Points

#### Nasion
- **Nasion:** Bridge of nose
- Anterior reference point
- Used for frontal measurements
- Landmark for placement

#### Inion
- **Inion:** Back of head (occipital protuberance)
- Posterior reference point
- Used for occipital measurements
- Landmark for placement

#### Preauricular Points
- **Preauricular points:** In front of ears
- Lateral reference points
- Used for temporal measurements
- Landmark for placement

### Best Practice
- Understand measurement logic
- Know reference points
- Use percentages, not absolute distances
- Verify measurements

## 5. Clinical Localization Examples

| EEG Finding | Likely Region | Electrodes |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **Focal spikes at T3** | Left temporal | T3, F7, T5 |
| **Slowing at F4** | Right frontal | F4, Fp2, F8 |
| **PDR maximal at O1/O2** | Occipital | O1, O2, Oz |
| **Spikes at C3** | Left central | C3, F3, P3 |
| **Generalized spike-and-wave** | Both hemispheres | All electrodes |

### Key Distinctions

#### Focal Findings
- **Focal findings:** Limited to specific region
- One or few electrodes involved
- Localized to specific area
- Suggests focal pathology

#### Generalized Findings
- **Generalized findings:** Both hemispheres
- Multiple electrodes involved
- Widespread distribution
- Suggests generalized process

### Best Practice
- Use electrode names for localization
- Know which electrodes = which regions
- Understand focal vs generalized
- Apply localization logic

## 6. Common ABRET Exam Traps

### Trap 1: Confusing Left vs Right Numbering
- **Reality:** Odd = left, even = right
- **Trap:** May confuse left and right
- **Solution:** Memorize odd = left, even = right
- **ABRET focus:** Electrode naming

### Trap 2: Misidentifying Electrode Regions
- **Reality:** Letters indicate regions
- **Trap:** May misidentify regions
- **Solution:** Memorize letter meanings
- **ABRET focus:** Regional identification

### Trap 3: Assuming Cz Is Frontal
- **Reality:** Cz is central, not frontal
- **Trap:** May think Cz is frontal
- **Solution:** Know that C = central
- **ABRET focus:** Electrode locations

### Trap 4: Forgetting Midline Designation
- **Reality:** "z" = midline
- **Trap:** May forget midline designation
- **Solution:** Remember "z" = midline
- **ABRET focus:** Midline electrodes

### Trap 5: Not Understanding Temporal Chain
- **Reality:** Temporal chain is F7–T3–T5 / F8–T4–T6
- **Trap:** May not understand temporal chain
- **Solution:** Learn temporal chain sequence
- **ABRET focus:** Temporal localization

## 7. Clinical Correlation

### Accurate Placement

#### Improves Localization
- **Improves localization:** Accurate placement = accurate localization
- Correct electrode position = correct brain region
- Enables precise localization
- Supports clinical correlation

#### Reduces Misinterpretation
- **Reduces misinterpretation:** Accurate placement prevents errors
- Misplacement leads to false localization
- Accurate placement prevents confusion
- Essential for correct interpretation

### Poor Placement Leads to False Localization
- **Poor placement leads to false localization**
- Incorrect electrode position = incorrect localization
- May lead to wrong diagnosis
- May lead to wrong treatment
- Must ensure accurate placement

### Best Practice
- Ensure accurate electrode placement
- Verify measurements
- Document placement accuracy
- Correct misplacement immediately

## 8. Case-Based Example

### Scenario
**Clinical Setting:** Routine EEG for seizure evaluation  
**EEG Finding:** Spike maximal at F7  
**Question:** What region is this?

### Interpretation
- **Left anterior temporal/frontal region**
- F7 = Left anterior temporal/frontal
- Spike maximal at F7 = focal finding
- Suggests left anterior temporal/frontal pathology
- May indicate focal epilepsy

### Teaching Point
- **Electrode name encodes both side and region**
- F7 tells us: F = frontal/temporal, 7 = left, anterior
- Electrode name provides localization
- Essential for interpretation
- Must know naming conventions

### ABRET Application
- Given electrode name → identify side and region
- Given F7 → left anterior temporal/frontal
- Given T3 → left mid-temporal
- Must know naming conventions
