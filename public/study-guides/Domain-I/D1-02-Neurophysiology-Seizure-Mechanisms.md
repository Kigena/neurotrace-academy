**Section:** Neurophysiology & Seizure Mechanisms  
**Style:** Conceptual but applied, exam-oriented

## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### EEG Reflects Postsynaptic Potentials, Not Action Potentials
- **EEG reflects postsynaptic potentials, not action potentials**
- Action potentials are too brief and small to be detected
- Postsynaptic potentials are slower and larger
- Many neurons must fire synchronously
- Scalp EEG detects synchronized activity

### Large Numbers of Neurons Must Fire Synchronously
- **Large numbers of neurons must fire synchronously**
- Individual neurons cannot be detected
- Thousands of neurons must fire together
- Synchronization is essential
- Without synchronization, no EEG signal

### Cortical Pyramidal Neurons Are Primary EEG Generators
- **Cortical pyramidal neurons are primary EEG generators**
- Pyramidal cells have vertical orientation
- Vertical orientation creates detectable fields
- Pyramidal cells are most numerous in cortex
- Other cell types contribute less

### Key Principle
- **Synchronization determines EEG visibility**
- Synchronized activity is visible
- Desynchronized activity is not visible
- Degree of synchronization affects amplitude
- Synchronization patterns create rhythms

### Practical Application
- Understand that EEG requires synchronization
- Know that postsynaptic potentials generate EEG
- Recognize that pyramidal cells are primary generators
- Appreciate that individual neurons are not detected

## 2. EEG Signal Generation

### Excitatory and Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials

#### Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials (EPSPs)
- **Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs):** Depolarizing potentials
- Make neurons more likely to fire
- Create positive or negative deflections
- Sum together to create larger signals
- Contribute to EEG activity

#### Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials (IPSPs)
- **Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs):** Hyperpolarizing potentials
- Make neurons less likely to fire
- Create opposite deflections
- Balance excitatory activity
- Contribute to EEG patterns

### Vertical Orientation of Pyramidal Cells
- **Vertical orientation of pyramidal cells:** Key to EEG detection
- Pyramidal cells are oriented perpendicular to cortex
- Vertical orientation creates detectable fields
- Parallel orientation allows summation
- Creates large enough fields for scalp detection

### Summation Across Cortical Columns
- **Summation across cortical columns:** Amplifies signals
- Many pyramidal cells in columns
- Synchronized activity sums together
- Creates larger, detectable signals
- Essential for scalp EEG detection

### ABRET Emphasis
- **Deep structures are poorly represented on scalp EEG**
- Deep structures (thalamus, hippocampus) are far from scalp
- Distance attenuates signals
- Deep activity may not be visible
- Surface structures are better represented

### Best Practice
- Understand that EEG requires synchronized, large populations
- Know that vertical orientation is essential
- Recognize that deep structures are poorly represented
- Appreciate that summation creates detectable signals

## 3. Neuronal Synchronization

### Normal Rhythms Arise from Synchronized Networks
- **Normal rhythms arise from synchronized networks**
- Alpha rhythm: Synchronized occipital activity
- Beta rhythm: Synchronized frontal activity
- Theta rhythm: Synchronized temporal activity
- Synchronization creates visible rhythms

### Excessive Synchronization → Pathologic Rhythms
- **Excessive synchronization → pathologic rhythms**
- Too much synchronization is abnormal
- Creates epileptiform patterns
- May indicate hyperexcitability
- Can lead to seizures

### Thalamocortical Circuits Influence Rhythm Generation
- **Thalamocortical circuits influence rhythm generation**
- Thalamus connects to cortex
- Thalamocortical loops create rhythms
- Sleep spindles: Thalamocortical activity
- Absence seizures: Thalamocortical hypersynchrony

### Best Practice
- Understand that synchronization creates rhythms
- Know that excessive synchronization is pathologic
- Recognize thalamocortical role in rhythms
- Appreciate network-level activity

---

## 4. Seizure Mechanisms (Basic)

### Imbalance Between Excitation and Inhibition
- **Imbalance between excitation and inhibition**
- Normal: Balance between excitation and inhibition
- Seizure: Imbalance favoring excitation
- Too much excitation → hyperexcitability
- Too little inhibition → disinhibition

### Hyperexcitable Neuronal Populations
- **Hyperexcitable neuronal populations**
- Neurons fire more easily
- Lower threshold for firing
- More likely to fire synchronously
- Creates epileptiform activity

### Hypersynchrony Produces Epileptiform Discharges
- **Hypersynchrony produces epileptiform discharges**
- Excessive synchronization
- Large populations fire together
- Creates spikes and sharp waves
- Visible on EEG

### EEG Correlate
- **Spikes and sharp waves reflect sudden synchronous depolarization**
- Spikes: Brief, synchronous depolarization
- Sharp waves: Slower, synchronous depolarization
- Both reflect hyperexcitability
- Both indicate seizure risk

### Best Practice
- Understand that seizures involve imbalance
- Know that hyperexcitability creates epileptiform activity
- Recognize that hypersynchrony produces spikes
- Appreciate that EEG reflects network-level activity

## 5. Focal vs Generalized Seizure Physiology

| Type | Mechanism | EEG Correlate |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **Focal** | Local cortical hyperexcitability | Focal spikes |
| **Generalized** | Widespread network involvement | Generalized spike-and-wave |

### Key Distinctions

#### Focal Seizures
- **Local cortical hyperexcitability:** Limited to one area
- Small population of hyperexcitable neurons
- Local synchronization
- Focal EEG patterns
- May spread to other areas

#### Generalized Seizures
- **Widespread network involvement:** Both hemispheres
- Large populations involved
- Widespread synchronization
- Generalized EEG patterns
- Thalamocortical networks involved

### Best Practice
- Understand that focal = local, generalized = widespread
- Know that mechanisms differ
- Recognize that EEG patterns reflect mechanisms
- Appreciate that both involve hyperexcitability

## 6. Factors Affecting EEG Expression

### Age
- **Age:** Affects EEG patterns
- Children: Different patterns than adults
- Background frequency increases with age
- Epileptiform patterns vary with age
- Must use age-appropriate norms

### Sleep
- **Sleep:** Affects EEG patterns
- Sleep stages create different patterns
- Sleep enhances epileptiform activity
- Sleep spindles are normal
- Must know sleep stage

### Medications
- **Medications:** Affect EEG patterns
- Antiepileptic drugs may suppress activity
- Sedatives may create slowing
- Stimulants may increase activity
- Must know medication effects

### Metabolic State
- **Metabolic state:** Affects EEG patterns
- Hypoglycemia: Slowing
- Hyperglycemia: Variable effects
- Metabolic encephalopathy: Diffuse slowing
- Must consider metabolic state

### ABRET Trap
- **Absence of epileptiform discharges does not exclude epilepsy**
- Normal EEG does not rule out epilepsy
- Interictal EEG may be normal
- Seizures may not be captured
- Clinical correlation is essential

### Best Practice
- Consider age, sleep, medications, metabolic state
- Know that normal EEG doesn't exclude epilepsy
- Understand that many factors affect EEG
- Appreciate that clinical correlation is essential

**Question:** What is the physiologic basis?

### Physiologic Basis

- Patterns reflect underlying mechanisms
- Understanding physiology helps interpret EEG

### ABRET Application
