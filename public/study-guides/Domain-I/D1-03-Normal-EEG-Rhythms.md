# NeuroTrace Study Guide

**Domain:** Domain I – Basic Concepts & Principles  
**Section:** Normal EEG Rhythms  
**Style:** Recognition-based, exam-oriented

---

## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### EEG Rhythms Are Classified by Frequency
- **EEG rhythms are classified by frequency**
- Frequency measured in Hz (cycles per second)
- Four main frequency bands: alpha, beta, theta, delta
- Frequency determines rhythm classification

### Normal Rhythms Vary By

#### Age
- **Age:** Different patterns at different ages
- Infants: Delta/theta predominant
- Children: Gradual emergence of alpha
- Adults: Stable alpha background
- Must use age-appropriate norms

#### State (Wake, Sleep)
- **State:** Different patterns in different states
- Wake: Alpha, beta
- Drowsiness: Theta, vertex waves
- Sleep: Delta, spindles, K-complexes
- Must know patient state

#### Region
- **Region:** Different patterns in different regions
- Frontal: Beta, theta
- Central: Mu rhythm
- Parietal: Variable
- Occipital: Alpha (PDR)

### Background Assessment Is Foundational to EEG Interpretation
- **Background assessment is foundational to EEG interpretation**
- Must assess background first
- Normal background is baseline
- Abnormalities are deviations from normal
- Background guides interpretation

### Key Principle
- **Normal background must be identified before pathology can be recognized**
- Cannot identify abnormal without knowing normal
- Background assessment is first step
- Normal vs abnormal comparison is essential

### Practical Application
- Always assess background first
- Use age-appropriate norms
- Consider patient state
- Recognize normal before calling abnormal

## 2. Alpha Rhythm

### Frequency: 8–13 Hz (Adults)
- **Frequency: 8–13 Hz (adults)**
- Most common in 9–11 Hz range
- May be slower in children
- May be faster in some individuals
- Frequency decreases with age in elderly

### Location: Posterior Dominant
- **Location: Posterior dominant**
- Maximal over occipital regions (O1, O2, Oz)
- May extend to parietal regions
- Usually symmetric
- May be asymmetric (normal variant)

### Reactivity

#### Attenuates with Eye Opening
- **Attenuates with eye opening:** Key characteristic
- Present with eyes closed
- Attenuates (reduces) with eyes open
- Returns when eyes close
- Reactivity confirms physiologic origin

#### Other Reactivity
- **Mental tasks:** May attenuate with mental tasks
- **Alertness:** May vary with alertness
- **Drowsiness:** May slow or disappear
- **Sleep:** Disappears in sleep

### ABRET Emphasis
- **Alpha rhythm defines normal adult background organization**
- Presence of alpha = organized background
- Absence of alpha = may indicate dysfunction
- Alpha is hallmark of normal adult EEG
- Must recognize alpha rhythm

### Best Practice
- Recognize alpha rhythm (8–13 Hz, posterior)
- Test reactivity (eye opening)
- Use alpha to assess background organization
- Know that absence may indicate dysfunction

## 3. Beta Rhythm

### Frequency: >13 Hz
- **Frequency: >13 Hz**
- Usually 14–30 Hz
- Low amplitude
- May be continuous or intermittent
- Common in frontal regions

### Location: Frontal Predominance
- **Location: Frontal predominance**
- Maximal over frontal regions (Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4)
- May be present centrally
- Usually symmetric
- Low amplitude

### Common Causes

#### Alertness
- **Alertness:** Increased alertness increases beta
- More prominent when alert
- May decrease with drowsiness
- Normal variant

#### Medications (e.g., Benzodiazepines)
- **Medications (e.g., benzodiazepines):** Increase beta
- Benzodiazepines: Prominent beta
- Other sedatives: May increase beta
- Medication effect, not pathology

### ABRET Trap
- **Excess beta may be medication-related, not pathologic**
- Must consider medications
- Excess beta is often medication effect
- Not necessarily abnormal
- Clinical correlation needed

### Best Practice
- Recognize beta rhythm (>13 Hz, frontal)
- Consider medications
- Know that excess beta may be medication-related
- Don't overcall beta as abnormal

## 4. Theta Rhythm

### Frequency: 4–7 Hz
- **Frequency: 4–7 Hz**
- Slower than alpha
- May be normal or abnormal
- Context determines significance
- Must consider age and state

### Normal In

#### Children
- **Children:** Theta is normal in children
- More prominent in younger children
- Decreases with age
- Age-appropriate
- Must use age norms

#### Drowsiness
- **Drowsiness:** Theta is normal in drowsiness
- Frontal theta in drowsiness
- Normal drowsy pattern
- Not pathologic
- State-dependent

### Abnormal If Excessive in Awake Adults
- **Abnormal if excessive in awake adults**
- Excessive theta in awake adults = slowing
- May indicate dysfunction
- Must distinguish from normal
- Context is critical

### Best Practice
- Recognize theta rhythm (4–7 Hz)
- Consider age and state
- Know when theta is normal vs abnormal
- Don't overcall theta in children or drowsiness

---

## 5. Delta Rhythm

### Frequency: <4 Hz
- **Frequency: <4 Hz**
- Slowest frequency band
- May be normal or abnormal
- Context determines significance
- Must consider age and state

### Normal In

#### Infants
- **Infants:** Delta is normal in infants
- Predominant in newborns
- Decreases with age
- Age-appropriate
- Must use age norms

#### Deep Sleep
- **Deep Sleep:** Delta is normal in deep sleep
- Stage 3/4 sleep: Delta activity
- Normal sleep pattern
- Not pathologic
- State-dependent

### Abnormal If Persistent in Awake Adults
- **Abnormal if persistent in awake adults**
- Persistent delta in awake adults = slowing
- May indicate dysfunction
- Must distinguish from normal
- Context is critical

### Best Practice
- Recognize delta rhythm (<4 Hz)
- Consider age and state
- Know when delta is normal vs abnormal
- Don't overcall delta in infants or sleep

## 6. Age-Related Norms

### Infants

#### Predominant Delta/Theta
- **Predominant delta/theta:** Normal in infants
- Newborns: Delta/theta predominant
- No alpha rhythm
- Age-appropriate
- Must use age norms

#### Development
- **Development:** Patterns change with development
- Alpha emerges gradually
- Frequency increases with age
- Organization improves
- Must track development

### Children

#### Gradual Emergence of Alpha
- **Gradual emergence of alpha:** Normal development
- Alpha appears around 3–4 months
- Frequency increases with age
- Becomes dominant by 8–10 years
- Must use age norms

#### Age-Specific Patterns
- **Age-specific patterns:** Different at different ages
- 3 months: 3–4 Hz dominant
- 1 year: 5–6 Hz dominant
- 3 years: 7–8 Hz dominant
- 8 years: 8–9 Hz dominant

### Adults

#### Stable Alpha Background
- **Stable alpha background:** Normal adult pattern
- 8–13 Hz alpha rhythm
- Posterior dominant
- Reactive to eye opening
- Stable pattern

### ABRET Emphasis
- **Age-appropriate norms are critical**
- Must use age-appropriate norms
- Cannot use adult norms for children
- Cannot use child norms for adults
- Age context is essential

### Best Practice
- Know age-appropriate norms
- Use correct norms for patient age
- Don't overcall slowing in children
- Don't undercall slowing in adults

## 7. Common ABRET Exam Traps

### Trap 1: Calling Normal Theta Abnormal in Children
- **Reality:** Theta is normal in children
- **Trap:** May call normal theta as abnormal
- **Solution:** Use age-appropriate norms
- **ABRET focus:** Age-dependent interpretation

### Trap 2: Mislabeling Beta as Epileptiform
- **Reality:** Beta is normal rhythm
- **Trap:** May call beta as spike or sharp wave
- **Solution:** Recognize beta morphology and frequency
- **ABRET focus:** Rhythm recognition

### Trap 3: Ignoring Eye-Opening Reactivity
- **Reality:** Reactivity confirms physiologic origin
- **Trap:** May not test reactivity
- **Solution:** Always test eye-opening reactivity
- **ABRET focus:** Reactivity testing

### Trap 4: Forgetting Age Context
- **Reality:** Age determines normal vs abnormal
- **Trap:** May use wrong age norms
- **Solution:** Always consider patient age
- **ABRET focus:** Age-appropriate interpretation

### Trap 5: Not Considering State
- **Reality:** State affects normal patterns
- **Trap:** May not consider wake vs sleep
- **Solution:** Always note patient state
- **ABRET focus:** State-dependent interpretation

## 8. Case-Based Example

### Scenario
**Clinical Setting:** Routine EEG for headache  
**EEG Finding:** 9 Hz posterior rhythm that attenuates with eye opening  
**Question:** Is this normal or abnormal?

### Interpretation
- **Normal adult alpha rhythm**
- 9 Hz is within alpha range (8–13 Hz)
- Posterior location is correct
- Reactivity confirms physiologic origin
- Normal finding

### Teaching Point
- **Reactivity confirms physiologic origin**
- Eye-opening reactivity is key
- Confirms that rhythm is physiologic
- Distinguishes from artifact
- Essential for identification

### ABRET Application
- Given posterior rhythm → check frequency and reactivity
- Given 8–13 Hz with reactivity → normal alpha
- Given absence of reactivity → may be artifact
- Must test reactivity to confirm
