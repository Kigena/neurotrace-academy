## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### EEG Signal Source
- EEG reflects **cortical pyramidal neuron activity**
- Deep brain structures are **not directly recorded** on scalp EEG
- Only cortical activity generates detectable scalp potentials

### Localization Depends On
- **Cortical region** (lobar anatomy)
- **Orientation of neurons** (perpendicular to scalp = best signal)
- **Skull/scalp attenuation** (affects amplitude and field distribution)

### Key Principle
- **EEG is a map of cortical function, not whole-brain anatomy**
- Subcortical structures influence EEG indirectly through cortical connections
- Deep lesions may cause diffuse or generalized changes, not focal EEG findings

### Practical Application
- Focal EEG abnormalities → cortical pathology
- Generalized abnormalities → may be cortical or subcortical origin
- Always correlate EEG with clinical presentation and imaging

## 2. Cerebral Lobes & EEG Correlates

### Frontal Lobe

#### Function
- Executive function
- Motor planning
- Behavioral regulation
- Working memory

#### EEG Findings
- **Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA)**
- Focal frontal slowing (theta/delta)
- Frontal sharp waves/spikes
- Frontal beta activity (motor cortex)

#### Clinical Correlation
- **Behavioral changes** (personality, executive dysfunction)
- **Motor seizures** (tonic, clonic, hypermotor)
- Frontal lobe epilepsy (often nocturnal)
- Encephalopathy with frontal predominance

#### ABRET Emphasis
- Frontal slowing often bilateral but may be asymmetric
- FIRDA suggests deep midline or diffuse dysfunction
- Frontal spikes may be subtle and require sleep

---

### Temporal Lobe

#### Function
- Memory (hippocampus)
- Language (dominant hemisphere)
- Auditory processing
- Emotion (amygdala)

#### EEG Findings
- **Temporal sharp waves** (most common focal epileptiform)
- Rhythmic theta/delta (temporal slowing)
- Temporal spikes
- Temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (TIRDA)

#### Clinical Correlation
- **Memory impairment**
- **Language deficits** (if dominant hemisphere)
- **Focal impaired awareness seizures**
- Temporal lobe epilepsy (most common focal epilepsy)

#### ABRET Emphasis
- **Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common focal epilepsy**
- Temporal sharp waves are high-yield pattern
- May require sleep or special electrodes (T1/T2, sphenoidal) to detect
- Mesial temporal sclerosis is common cause

---

### Parietal Lobe

#### Function
- Sensory integration
- Spatial awareness
- Calculation
- Reading

#### EEG Findings
- **Subtle focal slowing** (often poorly localized)
- Parietal spikes (less common)
- Frequently underrepresented on scalp EEG

#### Clinical Correlation
- Sensory seizures (paresthesias)
- Spatial neglect
- Gerstmann syndrome (if dominant hemisphere)

#### ABRET Trap
- Parietal abnormalities are often **poorly localized**
- May appear as "generalized" or "multifocal"
- Require careful montage analysis for localization

---

### Occipital Lobe

#### Function
- Visual processing
- Visual recognition

#### EEG Findings
- **Posterior dominant rhythm (PDR)** (normal alpha)
- Occipital spikes/sharp waves
- Occipital slowing
- **Photic sensitivity relevance** (occipital cortex responds to photic)

#### Clinical Correlation
- Visual seizures (auras, hallucinations)
- Visual field defects
- Occipital lobe epilepsy
- Photosensitive epilepsy

#### ABRET Emphasis
- PDR is normal finding (8-13 Hz in adults)
- Occipital spikes may be benign (especially in children)
- Photic stimulation activates occipital cortex
- Must differentiate normal PDR from occipital pathology

---

## 3. Hemispheric Lateralization

### Unilateral Abnormalities
- **Focal pathology** (structural lesion, focal epilepsy)
- Asymmetric slowing suggests focal cortical dysfunction
- Lateralized spikes/sharp waves indicate focal irritability

### Bilateral with Asymmetry
- **Focal dominance** (one hemisphere more affected)
- May indicate:
  - Unilateral lesion with contralateral effects
  - Bilateral process with asymmetric severity
  - Secondary generalization from focal onset

### Generalized Patterns
- **Diffuse or subcortical processes**
- Metabolic/toxic encephalopathy
- Generalized epilepsy
- Deep midline dysfunction

### Exam Trap
- **Asymmetric generalized slowing ≠ focal lesion automatically**
- May be:
  - Diffuse process with asymmetry
  - Technical artifact (electrode placement, impedance)
  - Normal variant (asymmetric alpha)
- Always correlate with clinical findings

## 4. Cortical vs Subcortical Patterns

| Pattern | Likely Source | EEG Characteristics |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Focal slowing** | Cortical lesion | Theta/delta over specific lobe(s) |
| **Generalized slowing** | Metabolic/toxic | Diffuse theta/delta, symmetric |
| **FIRDA** | Deep midline / diffuse dysfunction | Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta |
| **Burst-suppression** | Severe global dysfunction | Alternating bursts and suppression |
| **Focal spikes** | Cortical irritability | Sharp waves over specific region |
| **Generalized spikes** | Diffuse or subcortical | Bilateral synchronous spikes |

### Key Distinctions

#### Cortical Patterns
- **Focal** (localized to specific lobe)
- **Asymmetric** (one hemisphere affected)
- **Sharp/spiky morphology** (epileptiform)
- Correlate with structural lesions

#### Subcortical Patterns
- **Generalized** (bilateral, symmetric)
- **Diffuse slowing** (not focal)
- **Metabolic patterns** (triphasic waves, burst-suppression)
- May not show focal EEG changes

### ABRET Application
- Given EEG pattern → identify likely source (cortical vs subcortical)
- Given clinical presentation → predict EEG pattern
- Understand why deep lesions may not show focal EEG changes

## 5. Pediatric Considerations

### Incomplete Myelination
- Alters EEG appearance
- More slow activity is normal in children
- Background frequencies increase with age
- PDR frequency matures with age

### Localization Less Precise
- **Young children:** EEG fields are broader
- **Infants:** Multifocal patterns are common
- **Toddlers:** Localization improves but still less precise than adults

### Normal Variants Can Mimic Pathology
- **Rolandic spikes** (benign, central-temporal)
- **Occipital spikes** (benign, especially in children)
- **Frontal sharp transients** (normal sleep pattern)
- Must know age-appropriate norms

### ABRET Trap
- **Do not over-localize pediatric EEG findings**
- Multifocal spikes in children may be normal variant
- Always consider age when interpreting localization
- Pediatric EEG requires different localization criteria

### Age-Specific Localization
- **Neonates:** Very broad fields, multifocal common
- **Infants (0-1 year):** Localization improving but still broad
- **Children (2-12 years):** Better localization, but variants common
- **Adolescents/Adults:** Precise localization possible

## 6. Common ABRET Exam Traps

### Trap 1: Assuming Deep Lesions Produce Focal EEG Changes
- **Reality:** Deep structures (thalamus, basal ganglia) may cause generalized or no focal changes
- Deep lesions affect cortex diffusely through connections
- Don't expect focal EEG from deep pathology

### Trap 2: Over-Localizing Poorly Formed Slowing
- **Reality:** Subtle slowing may be poorly localized
- Parietal and deep frontal slowing often appear "generalized"
- Not all slowing can be precisely localized

### Trap 3: Ignoring State (Sleep vs Wake)
- **Reality:** Localization varies with state
- Some patterns only appear in sleep
- Sleep activates certain regions (frontal, temporal)
- Always note state when localizing

### Trap 4: Forgetting Age-Related EEG Differences
- **Reality:** Pediatric EEG has different localization rules
- Children have broader fields, more multifocal patterns
- Normal variants can mimic pathology
- Always consider age when localizing

### Trap 5: Not Correlating with Clinical Presentation
- **Reality:** EEG localization must match clinical findings
- Temporal spikes + memory problems = temporal lobe epilepsy
- Frontal slowing + behavioral changes = frontal dysfunction
- Always correlate EEG with clinical presentation

## 7. Case-Based Example

### Scenario
**Clinical Presentation:** 35-year-old with focal impaired awareness seizures  
**EEG Finding:** Left temporal sharp waves, maximum at T7  
**Clinical History:** Memory problems, déjà vu episodes

### Interpretation
- **EEG suggests:** Left temporal cortical irritability
- **Localization:** Left temporal lobe (dominant hemisphere)
- **Clinical correlation:** Matches seizure semiology (memory, déjà vu)

### Next Step
1. **Correlate with seizure semiology** (focal impaired awareness = temporal)
2. **Consider imaging** (MRI to look for mesial temporal sclerosis)
3. **Document localization** in technical report
4. **Note clinical correlation** (memory problems support temporal localization)

### Teaching Point
- **EEG localization must always be clinically correlated**
- Temporal sharp waves + temporal seizure semiology = strong correlation
- Isolated EEG finding without clinical correlation is less meaningful
- Always integrate EEG, clinical, and imaging findings

### ABRET Application
- Given EEG pattern → predict clinical presentation
- Given clinical presentation → predict EEG pattern
- Understand why correlation is essential for accurate interpretation
