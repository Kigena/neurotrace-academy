## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### EEG Matures with Brain Development
- **EEG matures with brain development:** Parallel maturation
- Brain development → EEG maturation
- Predictable changes with age
- Must understand developmental sequence
- Essential for interpretation

### Normal Patterns Vary Significantly with Age
- **Normal patterns vary significantly with age:** Age-dependent norms
- What is normal changes with age
- Cannot apply adult norms to children
- Age-appropriate interpretation required
- Critical concept

### Pediatric EEGs Require Different Interpretive Thresholds
- **Pediatric EEGs require different interpretive thresholds:** Different standards
- Children have different norms
- Must use age-appropriate criteria
- Cannot use adult standards
- Essential for accuracy

### Key Principle
- **Age determines what is normal on EEG**
- Age is primary factor
- Must know age-appropriate norms
- Cannot interpret without age context
- Fundamental principle

### Practical Application
- Always know patient age
- Apply age-appropriate norms
- Understand developmental sequence
- Avoid overinterpretation

## 2. Neonatal EEG (Birth – 2 Months)

### Discontinuous Background
- **Discontinuous background:** Normal in neonates
- Periods of activity alternating with quiet
- Discontinuity is normal
- Not pathologic
- Expected pattern

### Trace Alternant Patterns
- **Trace alternant patterns:** Characteristic neonatal pattern
- Alternating high and low amplitude
- Normal in quiet sleep
- Disappears with maturation
- Age-appropriate pattern

### Predominantly Delta Activity
- **Predominantly delta activity:** Normal in neonates
- Delta (<4 Hz) is dominant
- High amplitude delta
- Normal for age
- Expected finding

### Poor Organization
- **Poor organization:** Normal immaturity
- Background poorly organized
- Lacks adult-like organization
- Normal for age
- Not pathologic

### ABRET Emphasis
- **Discontinuity is normal in neonates**
- Must not call discontinuity abnormal
- Normal neonatal pattern
- Disappears with maturation
- Critical distinction

### Best Practice
- Recognize normal neonatal patterns
- Understand discontinuity is normal
- Know trace alternant pattern
- Apply age-appropriate norms

## 3. Infant EEG (2 Months – 2 Years)

### Increasing Continuity
- **Increasing continuity:** Maturing pattern
- Background becomes more continuous
- Less discontinuity
- Maturing organization
- Developmental change

### Dominant Delta and Theta
- **Dominant delta and theta:** Normal for age
- Delta still prominent
- Theta (4–7 Hz) increasing
- Normal frequency distribution
- Age-appropriate

### Emerging Sleep Features
- **Emerging sleep features:** Maturing sleep
- Sleep spindles appear
- K-complexes develop
- Sleep architecture maturing
- Normal development

### Best Practice
- Recognize maturing continuity
- Know delta/theta dominance is normal
- Understand emerging sleep features
- Apply infant norms

---

## 4. Childhood EEG (2 – 12 Years)

### Gradual Reduction in Delta
- **Gradual reduction in delta:** Maturing pattern
- Delta decreases with age
- Less prominent in wakefulness
- Normal maturation
- Age-appropriate change

### Increasing Theta and Alpha
- **Increasing theta and alpha:** Maturing frequencies
- Theta remains common
- Alpha emerges posteriorly
- Frequency increases with age
- Normal development

### Alpha Emerges Posteriorly with Age
- **Alpha emerges posteriorly with age:** Maturing PDR
- Posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) develops
- Frequency increases with age
- 6–8 Hz in young children
- 8–13 Hz in older children/adults

### ABRET Trap
- **Posterior dominant rhythm may be slow but normal**
- 6–7 Hz PDR is normal in young children
- Must not call slow PDR abnormal
- Age-appropriate frequency
- Critical distinction

### Best Practice
- Know PDR frequency increases with age
- Recognize slow PDR is normal in children
- Understand gradual maturation
- Apply childhood norms

---

## 5. Adolescent & Adult EEG

### Stable Alpha Rhythm (8–13 Hz)
- **Stable alpha rhythm (8–13 Hz):** Adult norm
- Posterior dominant rhythm
- 8–13 Hz frequency
- Stable with age
- Normal adult background

### Organized Background
- **Organized background:** Adult characteristic
- Well-organized background
- Clear state transitions
- Organized sleep architecture
- Mature pattern

### Reduced Theta/Delta During Wakefulness
- **Reduced theta/delta during wakefulness:** Adult norm
- Minimal theta/delta when awake
- Theta/delta in sleep is normal
- Awake theta/delta is abnormal
- Critical distinction

### Best Practice
- Know adult norms
- Recognize stable alpha rhythm
- Understand organized background
- Apply adult standards

## 6. Age-Related Comparison Table

| Age Group | Dominant Rhythm | Key Feature |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Neonate** | Delta | Discontinuous |
| **Infant** | Delta/Theta | Maturing continuity |
| **Child** | Theta → Alpha | Emerging PDR |
| **Adult** | Alpha | Stable background |

### Key Distinctions

#### Neonate vs Adult
- **Neonate:** Discontinuous, delta dominant, poor organization
- **Adult:** Continuous, alpha dominant, well-organized
- Very different patterns
- Both normal for age
- Must recognize differences

#### Child vs Adult
- **Child:** Slower PDR, more theta, less organized
- **Adult:** Faster PDR, less theta, well-organized
- Different norms
- Both normal for age
- Must apply correctly

### Best Practice
- Memorize age-related patterns
- Understand developmental sequence
- Know key distinctions
- Apply age-appropriate norms

## 7. Common ABRET Exam Traps

### Trap 1: Calling Pediatric Theta Abnormal
- **Reality:** Theta is normal in children
- **Trap:** May call theta abnormal in children
- **Solution:** Know theta is normal in pediatric EEGs
- **ABRET focus:** Age-appropriate theta

### Trap 2: Expecting Adult Alpha in Young Children
- **Reality:** Alpha develops gradually
- **Trap:** May expect 8–13 Hz alpha in young children
- **Solution:** Know PDR frequency increases with age
- **ABRET focus:** Age-appropriate PDR frequency

### Trap 3: Ignoring Developmental Stage
- **Reality:** Age determines normal
- **Trap:** May not consider age
- **Solution:** Always know patient age
- **ABRET focus:** Age context essential

### Trap 4: Overcalling Slowing in Pediatrics
- **Reality:** Slower rhythms are normal in children
- **Trap:** May call normal pediatric slowing abnormal
- **Solution:** Apply age-appropriate norms
- **ABRET focus:** Age-appropriate interpretation

### Trap 5: Not Recognizing Normal Neonatal Discontinuity
- **Reality:** Discontinuity is normal in neonates
- **Trap:** May call discontinuity abnormal
- **Solution:** Know discontinuity is normal in neonates
- **ABRET focus:** Neonatal normal patterns

## 8. Clinical Correlation

### Developmental Delay Alters EEG Maturation
- **Developmental delay alters EEG maturation:** Clinical correlation
- Delayed brain development → delayed EEG maturation
- EEG may appear younger than chronologic age
- Must correlate with clinical findings
- Important correlation

### Prematurity Affects EEG Appearance
- **Prematurity affects EEG appearance:** Corrected age
- Must use corrected age for prematurity
- Chronologic age may not match EEG age
- Corrected age is critical
- Essential consideration

### EEG Must Be Interpreted Alongside Age and Clinical History
- **EEG must be interpreted alongside age and clinical history:** Context essential
- Age provides context
- Clinical history guides interpretation
- Cannot interpret in isolation
- Essential correlation

### Best Practice
- Always know patient age
- Use corrected age for prematurity
- Correlate with clinical findings
- Apply age-appropriate norms

## 9. Case-Based Example

### Scenario
**Clinical Setting:** Routine EEG for 5-year-old child  
**EEG Finding:** 6 Hz posterior rhythm  
**Question:** Is this normal?

### Interpretation
- **Age-appropriate background**
- 6 Hz PDR is normal for 5-year-old
- Would be slow for adult
- Normal for age
- Age-appropriate finding

### Teaching Point
- **Normal EEG frequency increases with age**
- PDR frequency matures with age
- 6 Hz is normal in young children
- 8–13 Hz is normal in adults
- Age determines normal

### ABRET Application
- Given pediatric EEG → apply age norms
- Given slow PDR → consider age
- Given interpretation → know age context
- Must know age-appropriate frequencies
