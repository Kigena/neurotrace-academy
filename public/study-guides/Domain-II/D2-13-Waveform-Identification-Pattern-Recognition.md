## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### Waveform Identification Is Foundational
- **Waveform identification is foundational for EEG interpretation**
- Technologists must recognize normal vs abnormal patterns
- Pattern recognition guides further analysis
- Accurate identification is essential

### Normal Patterns Must Be Recognized
- **Normal patterns must be recognized to avoid misinterpretation**
- Many normal variants can mimic abnormal patterns
- Understanding normal patterns is critical
- Age-related differences are important

### Key Principle
- **Accurate pattern recognition guides interpretation and clinical correlation**
- Learn characteristic features of each pattern
- Understand normal vs abnormal

### Practical Application
- Learn to identify common waveforms
- Understand normal variants
- Recognize abnormal patterns
- Document observations accurately

## 2. Normal Background Rhythms

### Posterior Dominant Rhythm (PDR/Alpha)
- **Frequency:** 8-13 Hz (adults)
- **Location:** Posterior (occipital) regions
- **State:** Wakefulness, eyes closed
- **Characteristics:** Sinusoidal, symmetric, reactive to eye opening
- **Age:** Slower in children, may be slower in elderly

### Beta Activity
- **Frequency:** 20-30 Hz
- **Location:** Frontally predominant
- **Characteristics:** Low amplitude, may increase with medications (benzodiazepines, barbiturates)
- **Normal:** Present in wakefulness

### Theta Activity
- **Frequency:** 4-7 Hz
- **Location:** Temporal regions (adults), more prominent in children
- **Characteristics:** Low amplitude in adults, normal in children
- **Normal:** May be present in temporal regions

### Delta Activity
- **Frequency:** 1-3 Hz
- **Location:** Absent or minimal in normal awake adults
- **Characteristics:** High amplitude if present (abnormal in awake adults)
- **Normal:** Present in sleep, absent in wakefulness

### Key Rule
- **Normal background varies with age and state**
- Understand age-related norms
- Recognize reactivity (PDR attenuates with eye opening)

## 3. Normal Sleep Patterns

### Sleep Spindles
- **Frequency:** 11-15 Hz
- **Location:** Central regions (C3, C4, Cz)
- **State:** N2 sleep (stage 2)
- **Characteristics:** Rhythmic, brief bursts, symmetric
- **Age:** More prominent in children

### K-Complexes
- **Characteristics:** High-amplitude, sharp negative wave followed by positive wave
- **Location:** Central regions
- **State:** N2 sleep
- **Function:** Response to stimuli, sleep maintenance

### Vertex Waves
- **Characteristics:** Sharp, high-amplitude waves
- **Location:** Cz (vertex), maximal
- **State:** Light sleep (N1/N2)
- **Appearance:** Sharp, may be high amplitude

### POSTS (Positive Occipital Sharp Transients)
- **Characteristics:** Positive sharp waves
- **Location:** Occipital regions
- **State:** Sleep
- **Normal:** Benign sleep graphoelement

### Key Rule
- **Normal sleep patterns are age-specific**
- Learn sleep stage characteristics
- Recognize normal sleep graphoelements

## 4. Normal Variants

### Mu Rhythm
- **Frequency:** 8-13 Hz (alpha range)
- **Location:** Central regions (C3, C4)
- **Characteristics:** Arch-shaped, attenuates with contralateral limb movement
- **Normal:** Benign variant, not epileptiform

### Lambda Waves
- **Characteristics:** Positive sharp waves
- **Location:** Occipital regions
- **State:** Wakefulness, with eye movement/scanning
- **Normal:** Benign variant

### Wicket Spikes
- **Frequency:** 6-11 Hz
- **Location:** Temporal regions
- **State:** Drowsiness/sleep
- **Characteristics:** Arciform, do not disrupt background
- **Normal:** Benign variant, not epileptiform

### Key Rule
- **Normal variants must not be misinterpreted as abnormal**
- Learn distinguishing features
- Understand when variants are normal

---

## 5. Abnormal Patterns (Recognition Level)

### Epileptiform Discharges
- **Spikes:** <70 ms duration, sharp
- **Sharp waves:** 70-200 ms duration
- **Spike-and-wave:** Spike followed by slow wave
- **Location:** Focal or generalized

### Focal Slowing
- **Polymorphic delta:** Irregular, focal
- **Indicates:** Structural lesion, dysfunction
- **Location:** Focal region

### Diffuse Slowing
- **Theta/delta:** Widespread, reduced background organization
- **Indicates:** Encephalopathy, dysfunction
- **Severity:** Mild, moderate, severe

### Key Rule
- **Technologists identify patterns, not diagnoses**
- Describe patterns objectively
- Document observations accurately

---

## 6. Age-Related Patterns

### Neonatal Patterns
- **Trace alternant:** Alternating activity and quiescence (quiet sleep)
- **Discontinuous:** Periods of activity and quiescence (premature)
- **Active sleep vs quiet sleep:** Different from adult stages

### Pediatric Patterns
- **Slower PDR:** Age-dependent frequency
- **More prominent sleep spindles:** Longer duration
- **More theta:** Normal in temporal regions

### Key Rule
- **Normal patterns vary with age**
- Understand age-specific norms
- Adapt expectations for age
