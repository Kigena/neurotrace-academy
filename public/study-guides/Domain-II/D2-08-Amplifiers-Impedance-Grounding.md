## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### EEG Signals Are Low Amplitude (µV Range)
- **EEG signals are low amplitude (µV range):** Very small signals
- Typical EEG amplitude: 10–100 µV
- Much smaller than ECG (mV range)
- Requires amplification to be visible
- Susceptible to noise

### Amplifiers

#### Increase Signal Amplitude
- **Increase signal amplitude:** Make signals visible
- Amplify microvolt signals to displayable levels
- Essential for EEG recording
- Without amplification, signals are invisible
- Standard amplification: 10,000–100,000x

#### Reject Common Noise
- **Reject common noise:** Remove environmental interference
- Differential amplification rejects shared noise
- Common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) is critical
- Poor CMRR allows noise into recording
- Essential for clean signal

### Impedance Balance Is Critical
- **Impedance balance is critical:** More important than absolute values
- Balanced impedance reduces artifact
- Unbalanced impedance creates noise
- Large differences cause problems
- Must maintain balance across electrodes

### Key Principle
- **Signal quality depends more on impedance balance than absolute values**
- Balance is more important than low impedance alone
- Large differences cause artifact
- Even "acceptable" values can cause problems if unbalanced
- Must check balance, not just values

### Practical Application
- Always check impedance balance
- Maintain balanced impedance across electrodes
- Verify grounding
- Understand amplifier function

## 2. EEG Amplifiers

### Differential Amplifiers Compare

#### Active Electrode vs Reference
- **Active electrode vs reference:** Differential comparison
- Amplifier compares two inputs
- Active electrode: Signal of interest
- Reference electrode: Comparison point
- Difference is amplified and displayed

### Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR)

#### Ability to Reject Shared Noise
- **Ability to reject shared noise:** CMRR function
- Noise affecting both electrodes is rejected
- Only differences are amplified
- High CMRR = better noise rejection
- Low CMRR = more noise in recording

### ABRET Emphasis
- **Poor CMRR allows environmental noise into the EEG**
- Environmental noise (50/60 Hz) enters recording
- Creates artifact
- Reduces signal quality
- Must maintain good CMRR

### Amplifier Characteristics
- **High input impedance:** Does not load the signal
- **Low output impedance:** Drives display effectively
- **Wide frequency response:** Captures all EEG frequencies
- **Low noise:** Minimizes internal noise

### Best Practice
- Understand differential amplification
- Know CMRR importance
- Maintain good amplifier function
- Recognize amplifier-related issues

## 3. Electrode Impedance

### Measured in Ohms (Ω)
- **Measured in ohms (Ω):** Standard unit
- Impedance = resistance to AC current
- Different from DC resistance
- Measured at specific frequency (typically 10 Hz)
- Standard unit: kilohms (kΩ)

### Typical Acceptable Range

#### < 5–10 kΩ
- **< 5–10 kΩ:** Standard acceptable range
- Ideal: < 5 kΩ
- Acceptable: < 10 kΩ
- Problematic: > 10 kΩ
- Must check before recording

### Balanced Impedance Is More Important Than Low Impedance Alone
- **Balanced impedance is more important than low impedance alone**
- All electrodes should have similar impedance
- Large differences cause artifact
- Even if values are "acceptable"
- Balance is critical

### Impedance Measurement
- **Impedance measurement:** Standard procedure
- Measure before recording
- Check all electrodes
- Verify balance
- Document values

### ABRET Trap
- **Large impedance differences cause artifact even if values are "acceptable"**
- Example: 3 kΩ vs 8 kΩ (both "acceptable")
- Large difference creates artifact
- Must maintain balance
- Check differences, not just values

### Best Practice
- Target < 5 kΩ for all electrodes
- Maintain balanced impedance
- Check differences between electrodes
- Re-prep if unbalanced

## 4. Grounding

### Ground Electrode Stabilizes System
- **Ground electrode stabilizes system:** Essential function
- Provides reference point
- Stabilizes amplifier
- Reduces interference
- Essential for quality recording

### Reduces Environmental Electrical Interference
- **Reduces environmental electrical interference:** Noise reduction
- 50/60 Hz line noise
- Electromagnetic interference
- Equipment noise
- Environmental electrical noise

### Poor Grounding Increases 50/60 Hz Noise
- **Poor grounding increases 50/60 Hz noise:** Common problem
- Line frequency noise enters recording
- Creates 50/60 Hz artifact
- Reduces signal quality
- Must ensure good ground

### Ground Electrode Placement
- **Ground electrode placement:** Standard location
- Typically on forehead (Fpz) or mastoid
- Must have good contact
- Low impedance essential
- Check ground impedance

### Best Practice
- Always verify ground electrode
- Check ground impedance
- Ensure good contact
- Recognize grounding-related noise

## 5. Impedance-Related Artifacts

### Excessive Noise
- **Excessive noise:** High impedance artifact
- High impedance increases noise
- Unbalanced impedance creates noise
- Environmental noise enters recording
- Reduces signal quality

### Drifting Baseline
- **Drifting baseline:** Impedance instability
- Unstable impedance causes drift
- Electrode movement
- Poor contact
- Creates baseline artifact

### Channel Instability
- **Channel instability:** Impedance-related
- Fluctuating impedance
- Intermittent contact
- Electrode movement
- Creates unstable channel

### Corrective Actions

#### Re-prep Scalp
- **Re-prep scalp:** Improve contact
- Clean scalp thoroughly
- Remove oils and products
- Abrade gently if needed
- Reapply electrode

#### Replace Electrodes
- **Replace electrodes:** If damaged
- Check for damage
- Replace if necessary
- Ensure good contact
- Verify impedance

#### Check Connections
- **Check connections:** Verify wiring
- Check electrode connections
- Verify cable connections
- Test amplifier connections
- Fix loose connections

### Best Practice
- Recognize impedance-related artifacts
- Apply corrective actions
- Verify improvement
- Document issues

## 8. Case-Based Example

### Scenario
**Clinical Setting:** Routine EEG recording  
**Problem:** EEG shows excessive 60 Hz noise  
**Observation:** Noise present in all channels  
**Question:** What could cause this?

### Root Cause

- Both contribute to noise
- Technical issues, not physiologic

### Correct Action
- **Recheck ground and rebalance electrodes**
- Check ground electrode impedance
- Verify all electrode impedances
- Rebalance if needed
- Re-prep if necessary

### Teaching Point
- **Technical issues must be corrected before interpretation**
- Cannot interpret noisy EEG
- Must fix technical issues first
- Quality recording is essential
- Technical problems must be addressed

### ABRET Application
- Given noisy EEG → check impedance and grounding
- Given 60 Hz noise → check ground electrode
- Given artifact → consider impedance balance
- Must know troubleshooting steps
