## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### 10-20 System Is Standard for Electrode Placement
- **10-20 system is the international standard for EEG electrode placement**
- Ensures consistent, reproducible electrode positions
- Allows comparison across studies and facilities
- Based on percentages of head measurements

### Measurements Are Based on Head Anatomy
- **Measurements use anatomical landmarks:**
- Nasion (bridge of nose)
- Inion (back of head, occipital protuberance)
- Preauricular points (ear canals)
- Head circumference

### Key Principle
- **Consistent electrode placement ensures accurate localization and comparison**
- Proper placement is foundational for all EEG interpretation
- Measurements must be accurate

### Practical Application
- Measure carefully using anatomical landmarks
- Use 10% and 20% increments
- Verify electrode positions
- Document any deviations

## 2. Head Measurements

### Required Measurements
- **Nasion to Inion (sagittal):** Front to back of head
- **Left to Right Preauricular (coronal):** Ear to ear
- **Head Circumference:** Around head at electrode level

### Measurement Technique
- **Use flexible measuring tape**
- Measure along scalp surface (not straight line)
- Record measurements
- Calculate 10% and 20% increments

### Key Rule
- **Measurements must be accurate - errors affect all electrode positions**
- Double-check measurements
- Use consistent technique

## 3. 10-20 System Electrode Locations

### Frontal Electrodes
- **Fp1, Fp2:** 10% above nasion
- **F3, F4:** 20% from midline, 20% from Fp
- **F7, F8:** 10% above Fp, at temporal line
- **Fz:** Midline, 20% from Fp

### Central Electrodes
- **C3, C4:** 20% from midline, along central line
- **Cz:** Vertex (midpoint of nasion-inion and preauricular lines)

### Parietal Electrodes
- **P3, P4:** 20% from midline, along parietal line
- **Pz:** Midline, 20% from Cz

### Temporal Electrodes
- **T3, T4:** At temporal line, 20% from F7/F8
- **T5, T6:** Posterior temporal, 20% from T3/T4

### Occipital Electrodes
- **O1, O2:** 10% above inion, 20% from midline
- **Oz:** Midline, 10% above inion

### Key Rule
- **Electrode names indicate location:**
- Odd numbers = left, Even numbers = right
- Z = midline
- F = frontal, C = central, P = parietal, T = temporal, O = occipital

## 4. Electrode Application

### Skin Preparation
- **Clean skin:** Remove oils, lotions, dead skin
- **Abrade if necessary:** Light abrasion to reduce impedance
- **Apply conductive paste/gel:** Ensure good contact
- **Check impedance:** Verify <5 kΩ (ideally <2 kΩ)

### Application Technique
- **Apply electrodes systematically:** Follow consistent order
- **Ensure good contact:** No gaps, secure attachment
- **Check all electrodes:** Verify placement and impedance
- **Document any issues:** Note deviations or problems

### Key Rule
- **Proper application ensures optimal signal quality**
- Take time to prepare skin properly
- Verify impedance before recording

## 5. Ground and Reference Electrodes

### Ground Electrode
- **Location:** Typically Fpz or separate ground site
- **Purpose:** Electrical safety and signal reference
- **Essential for:** Safety and common-mode rejection

### Reference Electrodes
- **Common references:** A1 (left ear), A2 (right ear), Cz (vertex)
- **Linked ears:** A1+A2 (averaged)
- **Average reference:** All electrodes averaged
- **Selection affects:** Localization and artifact appearance

### Key Rule
- **Ground and reference are essential for recording**
- Must be properly applied
- Reference choice affects interpretation

---

## 6. Impedance Requirements

### Optimal Impedance
- **Target:** <5 kΩ (ideally <2 kΩ)
- **Balanced:** All electrodes should have similar impedance
- **Stable:** Impedance should remain stable during recording

### High Impedance Problems
- **Causes:** Poor skin preparation, inadequate paste/gel, poor contact
- **Effects:** Increased noise, artifacts, reduced signal quality
- **Solution:** Re-prepare electrode site

### Key Rule
- **Low, balanced impedance is essential for optimal signal quality**
- Check impedance before and during recording
- Re-prepare if impedance is high

---

## 7. Common Placement Errors

### Measurement Errors
- **Incorrect measurements:** Affect all electrode positions
- **Solution:** Double-check measurements, use consistent technique

### Application Errors
- **Poor contact:** High impedance, artifacts
- **Wrong location:** Affects localization
- **Solution:** Careful application, verify positions

### Key Rule
- **Errors in placement affect all subsequent interpretation**
- Take time to place electrodes correctly
- Verify positions before recording

## 8. Special Considerations

### Pediatric Patients
- **Smaller head size:** Use modified 10-20 system
- **Fewer electrodes:** Appropriate for head size
- **Age-specific:** Adapt for developmental stage

### Neonatal Patients
- **Modified system:** 9-11 electrodes typical
- **Smaller spacing:** Appropriate for head size
- **Age-specific patterns:** Different normal patterns

### Key Rule
- **Adapt technique for patient age and head size**
- Use appropriate electrode count
- Understand age-specific considerations
