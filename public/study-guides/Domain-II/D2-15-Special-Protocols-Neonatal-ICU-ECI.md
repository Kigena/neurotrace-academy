# NeuroTrace Study Guide

**Domain:** Domain II – Performing the EEG Study  
**Section:** Special Protocols (Neonatal/ICU/ECI)  
**Style:** Protocol-specific, age-adapted, exam-oriented

## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### Special Populations Require Special Protocols
- **Special populations require adapted protocols**
- Neonatal, ICU, and ECI patients have unique needs
- Protocols must be age-appropriate and condition-specific
- Understanding special protocols is essential

### Age-Specific Considerations
- **Age-specific considerations are critical**
- Neonatal patterns differ from adult patterns
- Electrode placement adapts for head size
- Normal patterns vary with age

### Key Principle
- **Special protocols ensure appropriate care for special populations**
- Adapt techniques for age and condition
- Understand age-specific normal patterns

### Practical Application
- Learn neonatal protocols
- Understand ICU continuous monitoring
- Know ECI considerations
- Adapt techniques appropriately

## 2. Neonatal EEG Protocols

### Electrode Placement
- **Modified 10-20 system:** 9-11 electrodes (reduced array)
- **Appropriate spacing:** For smaller head size
- **Standard locations:** Adapted for head size
- **Measurements:** Use nasion, inion, preauricular points

### Recording Parameters
- **Sensitivity:** Higher sensitivity (lower μV/mm) for lower amplitude
- **Timebase:** May use slower paper speed
- **Filters:** Standard (0.5-70 Hz) typically appropriate
- **Duration:** Longer recordings often needed

### Normal Patterns
- **Trace alternant:** Alternating activity and quiescence (quiet sleep, term neonates)
- **Discontinuous pattern:** Periods of activity and quiescence (premature neonates)
- **Active sleep vs quiet sleep:** Different from adult sleep stages
- **Age-dependent:** Patterns change with conceptual age (gestational + postnatal)

### Key Rule
- **Neonatal patterns are age-specific and state-dependent**
- Understand conceptual age
- Recognize normal neonatal patterns

## 3. ICU Continuous Monitoring

### Purpose
- **Continuous monitoring detects seizures and patterns**
- Nonconvulsive status epilepticus detection
- Pattern recognition (burst-suppression, periodic discharges)
- Treatment monitoring

### Setup
- **Electrode placement:** Standard or modified based on patient condition
- **Recording duration:** Continuous (hours to days)
- **Monitoring:** Remote or bedside
- **Alerts:** Automated or manual pattern detection

### Common Patterns
- **Burst-suppression:** Periods of activity alternating with suppression
- **Periodic discharges:** PLEDs (lateralized), GPDs (generalized)
- **Ictal patterns:** Evolving rhythmic activity
- **Rhythmic delta activity (RDA):** Focal or lateralized

### Event Detection
- **Ictal patterns:** Evolving frequency, amplitude, distribution
- **Status epilepticus:** Continuous or prolonged seizure activity
- **Pattern changes:** Indicating clinical changes
- **Immediate notification:** For concerning patterns

### Key Rule
- **ICU monitoring requires immediate notification of concerning patterns**
- Know when to notify medical team
- Understand ICU-specific patterns

## 4. ECI (Epilepsy Monitoring Unit) Protocols

### Purpose
- **ECI protocols optimize seizure capture**
- Long-term monitoring for seizure characterization
- Pre-surgical evaluation
- Medication adjustment monitoring

### Setup
- **Extended recording:** Days to weeks
- **Video-EEG:** Synchronized video and EEG
- **Activation procedures:** Sleep deprivation, medication reduction
- **Patient safety:** Seizure response protocols

### Key Considerations
- **Seizure safety:** Protocols for seizure management
- **Medication management:** May reduce medications
- **Activation:** Aggressive activation procedures
- **Documentation:** Detailed event documentation

### Key Rule
- **ECI protocols optimize diagnostic yield**
- Understand activation strategies
- Ensure patient safety

## 5. Age-Specific Modifications

### Neonatal Modifications
- **Fewer electrodes:** 9-11 typical
- **Higher sensitivity:** Lower amplitude signals
- **Longer recordings:** May need extended time
- **Parent presence:** For comfort and safety

### Pediatric Modifications
- **Standard electrode count:** Full 10-20 system
- **Age-appropriate patterns:** Slower PDR, more prominent sleep spindles
- **Child-friendly environment:** Comfort measures
- **Parent/caregiver presence:** As appropriate

### Key Rule
- **Adapt protocols for patient age and condition**
- Understand age-specific norms
- Ensure patient comfort and safety

---

## 6. Documentation for Special Protocols

### Required Documentation
- **Protocol used:** Neonatal, ICU, ECI
- **Modifications:** Any deviations from standard
- **Patient condition:** Relevant clinical information
- **Patterns observed:** Age-appropriate interpretation
- **Events:** All clinical events and EEG correlates

### Key Rule
- **Document protocol-specific information**
- Note any modifications
- Include age-specific considerations
