## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### Activation Procedures Enhance Diagnostic Yield
- **Activation procedures enhance diagnostic yield by provoking or modifying cerebral activity**
- Hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and sleep are standard activations
- Each procedure has specific indications and contraindications
- Proper technique is essential for effectiveness

### Safety Is Paramount
- **Patient safety overrides diagnostic yield**
- Know contraindications for each procedure
- Monitor patient during activation
- Stop if patient experiences distress

### Key Principle
- **Activation procedures increase likelihood of detecting epileptiform activity**
- Use appropriate procedures based on clinical indication
- Follow proper protocols

### Practical Application
- Know indications and contraindications
- Follow proper technique
- Monitor patient safety
- Document responses

## 2. Hyperventilation (HV)

### Purpose
- **Hyperventilation provokes epileptiform discharges**
- Particularly effective for absence seizures
- Creates hypocapnia (low CO2)
- Causes cerebral vasoconstriction

### Technique
- **Duration:** 3-5 minutes or until activation occurs
- **Rate:** Deep, regular breathing at 20-30 breaths per minute
- **Patient position:** Comfortable, able to breathe deeply
- **Monitoring:** Watch patient condition and EEG

### Normal Response
- **Children/adolescents:** Build-up of posterior slow activity (theta/delta)
- **Adults:** Minimal response or slight theta increase
- **Gradual development:** Build-up occurs over 1-3 minutes
- **Gradual resolution:** Resolves over 1-2 minutes after stopping

### Abnormal Response
- **Generalized spike-and-wave:** Absence epilepsy
- **Focal spikes:** Focal epilepsy
- **Excessive slowing:** May indicate encephalopathy

### Contraindications
- **Recent stroke:** Vasoconstriction risk
- **Severe cardiac disease:** Cardiovascular risk
- **Sickle cell disease:** Sickling crisis risk
- **Severe asthma:** Bronchospasm risk
- **Uncontrolled hypertension:** Cardiovascular risk

### Safety Monitoring
- **Watch for:** Chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, distress
- **Stop if:** Patient experiences any concerning symptoms
- **Document:** Response, duration, any complications

## 3. Photic Stimulation (IPS)

### Purpose
- **Photic stimulation tests for photosensitivity**
- Provokes photic driving (normal) or photosensitive epileptiform responses (abnormal)
- Tests visual system reactivity

### Technique
- **Flash lamp:** Positioned 30 cm from patient's eyes, at eye level
- **Eyes closed:** Standard protocol (enhances alpha range response)
- **Frequencies:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 Hz (or similar range)
- **Duration:** 10 seconds per frequency
- **Intensity:** Standardized, moderate intensity

### Normal Response
- **Photic driving:** Posterior rhythm matches flash frequency (most prominent 8-16 Hz)
- **Harmonics:** Multiples of flash frequency (e.g., 20 Hz with 10 Hz flashes)
- **Subharmonics:** Fractions of flash frequency (e.g., 6 Hz with 12 Hz flashes)
- **May not occur at all frequencies:** Normal variability

### Abnormal Response
- **Photosensitive epileptiform response:** Generalized spike-and-wave time-locked to flash
- **Focal spikes:** Focal photosensitivity
- **Myoclonic response:** Clinical myoclonus

### Contraindications
- **Photosensitive seizures:** Use reduced intensity, specific frequencies to avoid, emergency response ready
- **Recent eye surgery:** Consult physician
- **Severe photosensitivity:** May need to skip or modify protocol

### Safety Monitoring
- **Watch for:** Seizure activity, myoclonus, patient distress
- **Stop if:** Seizure occurs or patient requests
- **Document:** Frequencies tested, responses, any complications

## 4. Sleep Activation

### Purpose
- **Sleep activation enhances detection of epileptiform discharges**
- Particularly effective for focal temporal lobe epilepsy (10-100x increase)
- Activates sleep-specific patterns
- Increases diagnostic yield

### Sleep Deprivation
- **Purpose:** Increase likelihood of sleep during study
- **Technique:** Patient stays awake longer than usual (typically 4-6 hours less sleep)
- **Effectiveness:** Enhances sleep during study and activation of discharges

### Sleep Stages
- **N1 (Stage 1):** Light sleep, vertex waves
- **N2 (Stage 2):** Sleep spindles (11-15 Hz), K-complexes
- **N3 (Stage 3):** Deep sleep, high-amplitude delta (>20% of epoch)
- **REM:** Low-voltage, mixed-frequency, rapid eye movements, muscle atonia

### Normal Sleep Patterns
- **Sleep spindles:** 11-15 Hz, central, N2 sleep
- **K-complexes:** High-amplitude, sharp negative-positive, N2 sleep
- **Vertex waves:** Sharp, high-amplitude, Cz, light sleep
- **POSTS:** Positive occipital sharp transients, sleep

### Abnormal Sleep Patterns
- **Epileptiform discharges:** Increased during sleep
- **Sleep-specific patterns:** ESES, continuous spike-and-wave during sleep
- **Abnormal sleep architecture:** May indicate encephalopathy

## 5. Combined Activation

### Sleep + Hyperventilation
- **Technique:** Perform hyperventilation during drowsiness/sleep
- **Effectiveness:** May enhance activation
- **Use:** When single activation is insufficient

### Sleep + Photic
- **Technique:** Perform photic stimulation during sleep
- **Effectiveness:** May enhance photosensitive responses
- **Use:** For suspected photosensitive epilepsy

### Key Rule
- **Combined activations may enhance diagnostic yield**
- Use when clinically indicated
- Follow safety protocols for all procedures

## 6. Documentation

### Required Documentation
- **Procedures performed:** Hyperventilation, photic, sleep
- **Technique:** Duration, frequencies, patient cooperation
- **Responses:** Normal vs abnormal, timing, characteristics
- **Complications:** Any adverse events or patient distress
- **Contraindications:** Any procedures not performed and why

### Key Rule
- **Complete documentation is essential**
- Document all procedures and responses
- Note any limitations or complications
