## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### Artifacts Are Non-Cerebral Signals
- **Artifacts are electrical signals not originating from the brain**
- Can obscure underlying EEG activity
- Must be identified and resolved or documented
- Understanding artifacts is essential for accurate interpretation

### Troubleshooting Hierarchy
- **First:** Identify the artifact type
- **Second:** Attempt to eliminate the source
- **Third:** Use filters only if source cannot be resolved
- **Last resort:** Document persistent artifacts

### Key Principle
- **Eliminate artifacts at the source whenever possible**
- Do not rely solely on filters
- Document persistent artifacts

### Practical Application
- Learn to identify common artifacts
- Know troubleshooting techniques
- Understand when to use filters
- Document artifacts appropriately

## 2. Muscle Artifact (EMG)

### Characteristics
- **Frequency:** 20-300 Hz (high-frequency)
- **Appearance:** Irregular, spiky, high-amplitude
- **Location:** Maximal in temporal/frontal regions
- **Cause:** Muscle tension (jaw, neck, face)

### Identification
- **Visual:** High-frequency, irregular spikes
- **Location:** Temporal/frontal regions
- **Synchronous:** With visible muscle tension
- **Effect:** Obscures underlying EEG

### Troubleshooting
- **Ask patient to relax:** Reduce jaw tension, neck tension
- **Reposition if necessary:** Adjust patient position
- **Reduce tension:** Comfort measures
- **HFF filter:** Last resort (reduces but doesn't eliminate)

### Key Rule
- **Muscle artifact is common and often resolvable**
- Address the source first
- Filter only if necessary

## 3. Eye Movement Artifacts

### Eye Blink Artifact
- **Characteristics:** High-amplitude deflections, frontally maximal (Fp1/Fp2)
- **Synchronous:** With blinking
- **Cause:** Corneoretinal potential (cornea positive, retina negative)
- **Polarity:** Positive deflection in Fp1 when cornea moves toward it

### Lateral Eye Movement
- **Characteristics:** Deflections in Fp1/Fp2, opposite polarity for left vs right
- **Synchronous:** With eye movement
- **Cause:** Corneoretinal potential
- **Identification:** Opposite polarity in Fp1 vs Fp2

### Troubleshooting
- **Ask patient to keep eyes closed or open:** Consistent position
- **Reposition Fp1/Fp2:** If necessary
- **Document:** If persistent

### Key Rule
- **Eye artifacts are normal and expected**
- Can be reduced but not always eliminated
- Document if persistent

## 4. ECG Artifact

### Characteristics
- **Frequency:** Regular, rhythmic
- **Rate:** 60-100/min (heart rate)
- **Location:** Maximal in temporal/occipital regions (near arteries)
- **Cause:** Cardiac electrical activity

### Identification
- **Visual:** Regular, rhythmic deflections
- **Rate:** Matches pulse/heart rate
- **Location:** Temporal/occipital regions
- **Synchronous:** With heartbeat

### Troubleshooting
- **Reposition electrodes:** Away from neck vessels
- **Use different reference:** May reduce artifact
- **Add ECG channel:** For correlation
- **Document:** If persistent

### Key Rule
- **ECG artifact is common and identifiable**
- Repositioning often helps
- ECG channel can confirm

## 5. 60 Hz Line Noise

### Characteristics
- **Frequency:** 60 Hz (or 50 Hz in some regions)
- **Appearance:** Regular, sinusoidal
- **Location:** All channels
- **Cause:** Electrical interference from power lines, unshielded equipment

### Identification
- **Visual:** Regular 60 Hz activity
- **Location:** All channels
- **Effect:** Obscures underlying EEG

### Troubleshooting
- **Check grounding:** Ensure proper grounding
- **Check electrode impedance:** High impedance increases susceptibility
- **Eliminate sources:** Unshielded equipment, fluorescent lights
- **Notch filter:** Last resort (affects signals near 60 Hz)

### Key Rule
- **Eliminate 60 Hz at the source**
- Check grounding and impedance first
- Notch filter is last resort

---

## 6. Electrode Artifacts

### Electrode Pop
- **Characteristics:** Sudden, high-amplitude, brief deflections
- **Location:** Single electrode
- **Cause:** Poor contact, sudden impedance changes
- **Appearance:** Sharp, brief, often returns to baseline

### High-Impedance Artifact
- **Characteristics:** Increased noise, baseline instability, 60 Hz
- **Location:** Affected channels
- **Cause:** High or unstable impedance
- **Effect:** Reduced signal quality

### Troubleshooting
- **Re-prepare electrode:** Clean skin, reapply paste/gel
- **Check impedance:** Verify <5 kΩ
- **Replace electrode/cable:** If problem persists
- **Document:** If persistent

### Key Rule
- **Electrode artifacts indicate technical problems**
- Re-preparation usually resolves
- Replace equipment if necessary

## 7. Movement Artifacts

### Characteristics
- **Appearance:** Irregular, high-amplitude deflections
- **Location:** Multiple channels
- **Synchronous:** With patient movement
- **Cause:** Patient movement, cable movement

### Troubleshooting
- **Secure cables:** Prevent cable movement
- **Ensure patient comfort:** Minimize movement
- **Cable management:** Organize cables
- **Document:** If persistent

### Key Rule
- **Movement artifacts are preventable**
- Secure cables and ensure comfort
- Document if persistent

## 8. Other Artifacts

### Sweat Artifact
- **Characteristics:** Slow, irregular baseline drift
- **Location:** Multiple electrodes
- **Cause:** Sweat changing electrode impedance
- **Troubleshooting:** Cool environment, ensure comfort, maintain good contact

### Pulse Artifact
- **Characteristics:** Regular, rhythmic at pulse rate (60-100/min)
- **Location:** Temporal/occipital regions (near arteries)
- **Cause:** Arterial pulsation
- **Troubleshooting:** Reposition electrodes if possible, document

### Glossokinetic Artifact
- **Characteristics:** Slow, rhythmic deflections, temporal regions
- **Cause:** Tongue movement (electrical potential)
- **Troubleshooting:** Ask patient to keep tongue still

### Chewing Artifact
- **Characteristics:** Irregular, high-amplitude, temporal regions
- **Cause:** Jaw movement, masseter muscle
- **Troubleshooting:** Ask patient to stop chewing, relax jaw

### Shiver/Tremor Artifact
- **Characteristics:** Regular, rhythmic at tremor frequency (4-8 Hz)
- **Cause:** Visible tremor
- **Troubleshooting:** Document, may be unavoidable

## 9. Troubleshooting Strategy

### Systematic Approach
1. **Identify artifact type:** Visual characteristics, location, frequency
2. **Determine source:** Patient, equipment, environment
3. **Attempt resolution:** Address source directly
4. **Use filters if necessary:** Last resort
5. **Document:** Persistent artifacts and resolution attempts

### Key Rule
- **Follow troubleshooting hierarchy**
- Eliminate source first
- Filter only if necessary
- Document appropriately
