## 1. Core Concepts (Must Know)

### Signal Detection
- EEG electrodes detect **voltage differences**, not absolute voltage
- Electrodes measure potential difference between two points
- Common reference allows comparison across channels

### Signal Quality Depends On
- **Electrode contact** (skin-electrode interface)
- **Impedance balance** (equal impedance across electrodes)
- **Skin preparation** (removal of oils, dead skin, hair products)
- **Electrode material** (affects stability and noise)

### Impedance Definition
- Impedance reflects **resistance + capacitance**
- Measured in ohms (Ω)
- Represents opposition to electrical flow
- Includes skin resistance and electrode-skin interface

### Key Principle
- **Low and balanced impedance improves signal-to-noise ratio**
- More important than absolute value: **impedance balance**
- Unequal impedance creates artifacts and noise
- High impedance increases susceptibility to interference

### Practical Application
- Always check impedance before recording
- Re-check impedance if artifacts appear
- Balance impedance across all electrodes
- Document impedance values in technical report

## 2. EEG Electrode Types

### Common Materials

#### Silver–Silver Chloride (Ag/AgCl) – Preferred
- **Most stable recordings**
- Low noise characteristics
- Good for long-term recordings
- Standard for clinical EEG

#### Gold
- Good conductivity
- Less stable than Ag/AgCl
- May require more frequent reapplication
- Used in some specialized applications

#### Tin
- Adequate for short recordings
- Less stable than Ag/AgCl
- May have higher noise
- Less commonly used in modern EEG

### ABRET Emphasis
- **Ag/AgCl electrodes provide the most stable recordings**
- Preferred material for clinical EEG
- Understand why material choice matters

### Electrode Forms

#### Cup Electrodes
- Reusable or disposable
- Applied with conductive paste or gel
- Most common in clinical EEG
- Allow for impedance measurement

#### Disposable Electrodes
- Pre-gelled, single-use
- Convenient but may have higher impedance
- Good for quick setups
- May not allow impedance measurement

#### Needle Electrodes (Limited EEG Use)
- Inserted subcutaneously
- Lower impedance but invasive
- **Safety note:** Increase infection risk
- Rarely used in routine EEG
- Reserved for special circumstances

### Safety Considerations
- **Needle electrodes increase infection risk**
- Require sterile technique
- Contraindicated in patients with bleeding disorders
- Must follow infection control protocols

## 3. Understanding Impedance

### Measurement
- Measured in **ohms (Ω)**
- Represents opposition to electrical flow
- Includes both resistance and capacitance components

### Components of Impedance
- **Skin resistance** (primary component)
- **Electrode-skin interface** (contact quality)
- **Electrode material** (affects interface)
- **Conductive paste/gel** (reduces impedance)

### Typical Acceptable Ranges

#### Preferred: ≤ 5 kΩ
- Optimal signal quality
- Minimal artifact
- Best for clinical interpretation
- Standard for most recordings

#### Acceptable: ≤ 10 kΩ
- Adequate for most purposes
- May have slightly increased noise
- Acceptable if balanced across electrodes
- May require more frequent monitoring

#### Unacceptable: > 10 kΩ
- Increased artifact risk
- Poor signal quality
- May mask true cerebral signals
- Requires immediate correction

### Critical Point
- **More important than absolute value: impedance balance**
- Unequal impedance is worse than uniformly high impedance
- Balance reduces common-mode noise
- Always check for impedance balance

---

## 4. Impedance Balance vs Absolute Value

### Balanced Impedance Reduces
- **Common-mode noise** (noise affecting all channels equally)
- **60 Hz interference** (power line noise)
- **Artifact propagation** (artifacts spreading across channels)
- **Baseline drift** (unstable recordings)

### Unequal Impedance Increases Artifact
- **60 Hz interference** (especially with unequal impedance)
- **Electrode pop** (sudden impedance changes)
- **Drift** (unstable electrode interface)
- **Channel-specific noise** (affecting only high-impedance channels)

### ABRET Trap
- **Low impedance alone does NOT guarantee artifact-free EEG**
- Must also have **balanced impedance**
- Can have low impedance but still have artifacts if unbalanced
- Always check both absolute value and balance

### Practical Application
- Check impedance of all electrodes
- Ensure all electrodes are within acceptable range
- Verify impedance is balanced (similar values across electrodes)
- Re-check if artifacts appear during recording

## 5. Impedance-Related Artifacts

| Artifact | Likely Cause | Solution |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **60 Hz interference** | High or unequal impedance | Lower impedance, balance electrodes |
| **Electrode pop** | Poor contact or drying paste | Re-prep skin, reapply electrode |
| **Drift** | Unstable electrode interface | Improve contact, check paste |
| **Excess noise** | Inadequate skin prep | Clean skin, remove oils |
| **Baseline shift** | Impedance changes during recording | Re-check impedance, reapply electrode |
| **Channel-specific artifact** | One electrode with high impedance | Fix that specific electrode |

### Recognition Tips
- **60 Hz:** Regular 60 Hz oscillations, often in one channel
- **Electrode pop:** Sudden, brief deflections, often repetitive
- **Drift:** Slow baseline movement, not cerebral in origin
- **Excess noise:** High-frequency noise, obscures cerebral activity

### ABRET Application
- Given artifact → identify likely impedance cause
- Given impedance values → predict likely artifacts
- Understand why impedance matters for artifact prevention

## 6. Common ABRET Exam Traps

### Trap 1: Believing Impedance of 0 is Ideal
- **Reality:** Some impedance is normal and expected
- Very low impedance may indicate bridging (electrodes touching)
- Target is ≤ 5 kΩ, not zero
- Zero impedance suggests technical problem

### Trap 2: Ignoring Impedance Balance
- **Reality:** Balance is more important than absolute value
- Unequal impedance causes more problems than uniformly high impedance
- Always check for balance, not just individual values
- One high-impedance electrode can affect entire recording

### Trap 3: Confusing Impedance with Sensitivity
- **Reality:** These are independent settings
- **Impedance** affects signal quality and artifact
- **Sensitivity** affects amplitude display (µV/mm)
- Don't confuse signal quality with amplitude settings

### Trap 4: Assuming Digital EEG Corrects Poor Electrode Contact
- **Reality:** Digital EEG still requires good electrode contact
- Digital systems may mask some artifacts but cannot fix poor contact
- Always verify impedance, even with digital systems
- Good technique is essential regardless of system type

### Trap 5: Not Re-Checking Impedance During Recording
- **Reality:** Impedance can change during recording
- Paste can dry, electrodes can shift, skin can sweat
- Re-check impedance if artifacts appear
- Document impedance checks in technical report

---

## 7. Clinical Correlation

### Poor Impedance Can
- **Mimic epileptiform activity** (electrode pop can look like spikes)
- **Mask true cerebral signals** (noise obscures real activity)
- **Create false abnormalities** (artifacts mistaken for pathology)
- **Reduce diagnostic yield** (poor quality limits interpretation)

### Pediatric and Agitated Patients
- **Require frequent rechecks** (movement disrupts contact)
- May have higher baseline impedance (smaller head, more movement)
- Need careful skin prep (may be more difficult)
- May require more frequent electrode reapplication

### Best Practice
- Check impedance at start of recording
- Re-check if artifacts appear
- Document impedance values
- Balance impedance across all electrodes
- Verify impedance before interpreting abnormalities

### Clinical Impact
- Poor impedance → poor signal quality → limited interpretation
- Artifacts from poor impedance can lead to misdiagnosis
- Good impedance technique is essential for quality EEG
- Always verify technical quality before clinical interpretation

## 8. Case-Based Example

### Scenario
**Clinical Setting:** Routine EEG recording  
**EEG Finding:** Excessive 60 Hz noise in one channel (T7)  
**Other Channels:** Normal, minimal artifact  
**Impedance Check:** Not performed initially

### Hidden Issue
- **One electrode (T7) impedance significantly higher than others**
- T7 impedance: 25 kΩ (unacceptable)
- Other electrodes: 3-5 kΩ (acceptable)
- Unequal impedance causing 60 Hz interference in T7 channel

### Correct Action
1. **Re-prep skin** at T7 location (clean thoroughly)
2. **Reapply electrode** with fresh conductive paste
3. **Re-check impedance** (should be ≤ 5 kΩ)
4. **Verify artifact resolved** (60 Hz noise should disappear)
5. **Document** impedance values and corrective action

### Teaching Point
- **Always verify impedance before interpreting abnormalities**
- 60 Hz artifact in one channel suggests impedance problem
- Unequal impedance is common cause of channel-specific artifacts
- Good technique prevents artifacts and improves diagnostic yield

### ABRET Application
- Given artifact pattern → identify likely cause (impedance)
- Given impedance values → predict likely artifacts
- Understand corrective actions for impedance problems
- Know when to re-check impedance during recording
