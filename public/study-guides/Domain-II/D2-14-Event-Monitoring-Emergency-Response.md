## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### Event Monitoring Is Critical
- **Event monitoring is critical for correlating EEG with clinical manifestations**
- Clinical events must be marked immediately
- Complete documentation is essential
- Event annotation guides interpretation

### Patient Safety Is First Priority
- **Patient safety is first priority during emergencies**
- Know emergency response protocols
- Activate emergency response when needed
- Continue recording if it can be done safely

### Key Principle
- **Event monitoring and emergency response ensure patient safety and diagnostic accuracy**
- Mark events immediately
- Activate emergency response promptly when needed

### Practical Application
- Mark all clinical events
- Document events completely
- Know emergency protocols
- Prioritize patient safety

## 2. Event Annotation

### What to Mark
- **Clinical events:** Seizures, movements, behaviors
- **State changes:** Wake to sleep, sleep to wake
- **Patient responses:** To activation procedures
- **Technical events:** Electrode problems, equipment issues

### How to Mark
- **Immediately:** Mark at time of occurrence
- **Clear marking:** Use event markers/buttons
- **Description:** Note clinical description
- **Timing:** Document exact time

### Documentation Requirements
- **Time:** Exact time of event
- **Clinical description:** What was observed
- **Duration:** How long it lasted
- **EEG changes:** Any EEG correlates
- **Patient response:** Recovery, post-event state

### Key Rule
- **Mark events immediately and document completely**
- Do not wait until end of study
- Complete documentation is essential

---

## 3. Clinical Event Types

### Seizures
- **Generalized tonic-clonic:** Convulsive, loss of consciousness
- **Absence:** Staring, unresponsiveness
- **Focal:** Localized symptoms, may have awareness
- **Myoclonic:** Brief jerks
- **Atonic:** Drop attacks

### Non-Seizure Events
- **Movement:** Patient repositioning, restlessness
- **Behavioral:** Confusion, agitation
- **Respiratory:** Breathing changes, apnea
- **Cardiac:** Palpitations, changes in heart rate

### Key Rule
- **Mark all clinical events, not just seizures**
- Complete documentation helps interpretation
- Clinical correlation is essential

---

## 4. Emergency Response

### When to Activate
- **Status epilepticus:** Seizure >5 minutes or continuous
- **Cardiac arrest:** No pulse, unresponsive
- **Respiratory distress:** Severe breathing problems
- **Anaphylaxis:** Allergic reaction with breathing difficulty
- **Any life-threatening emergency**

### How to Activate
- **Follow facility protocol:** Code Blue, emergency button
- **Notify medical team:** Immediately
- **Continue recording:** If it can be done safely
- **Document:** All actions taken

### Key Rule
- **Activate emergency response immediately for life-threatening situations**
- Do not delay
- Patient safety is first priority

---

## 5. Seizure Response

### During Seizure
- **Ensure patient safety:** Protect head, prevent injury
- **Do NOT place objects in mouth:** Critical safety rule
- **Time the seizure:** Duration is important
- **Maintain airway:** If possible
- **Continue recording:** If it can be done safely

### After Seizure
- **Position patient:** Recovery position (on side)
- **Check breathing and pulse:** Assess condition
- **Monitor patient:** Continue observation
- **Document:** Seizure characteristics, duration, recovery

### Key Rule
- **Patient safety first, then recording**
- Never place objects in mouth during seizure
- Continue recording if safe

---

## 6. Status Epilepticus

### Recognition
- **Generalized tonic-clonic:** >5 minutes duration
- **Nonconvulsive:** Continuous seizure activity on EEG
- **Multiple seizures:** Without return to baseline
- **Medical emergency:** Requires immediate intervention

### Response
- **Activate emergency response:** Immediately
- **Notify physician:** Immediately
- **Ensure patient safety:** First priority
- **Continue recording:** If it can be done safely

### Key Rule
- **Status epilepticus is a medical emergency**
- Activate emergency response immediately
- Do not wait

---

## 7. Documentation of Events

### Required Information
- **Time:** Exact time of event
- **Clinical description:** What was observed
- **Duration:** How long it lasted
- **EEG changes:** Any EEG correlates
- **Patient response:** Recovery, post-event state
- **Actions taken:** Emergency response, notifications

### Key Rule
- **Complete documentation is essential**
- Document all events and responses
- Include timing and clinical details

---
