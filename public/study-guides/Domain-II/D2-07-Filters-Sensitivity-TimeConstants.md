## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### Filters Modify Signal Frequencies Displayed
- **Filters modify signal frequencies displayed**
- Low-frequency filter (LFF): Removes slow frequencies
- High-frequency filter (HFF): Removes fast frequencies
- Filters shape what is visible
- Do not change brain activity

### Sensitivity Controls Vertical Amplitude Scaling
- **Sensitivity controls vertical amplitude scaling**
- Measured in µV/mm
- Lower number = higher sensitivity (larger display)
- Higher number = lower sensitivity (smaller display)
- Does not change actual amplitude

### Improper Settings Distort EEG Interpretation
- **Improper settings distort EEG interpretation**
- High LFF: Masks slow waves
- Low HFF: Masks spikes
- Wrong sensitivity: May miss abnormalities
- Must use correct settings

### Key Principle
- **Technical settings affect appearance, not brain activity**
- Settings change display, not brain
- Must verify settings before interpreting
- Settings can create false appearances
- Always check settings first

### Practical Application
- Always verify filter and sensitivity settings
- Understand how settings affect appearance
- Use appropriate settings for clinical scenario
- Document settings in report

## 2. Low-Frequency Filter (LFF)

### Controls Slow-Frequency Cutoff
- **Controls slow-frequency cutoff:** Removes frequencies below cutoff
- Typical setting: 0.1–0.3 Hz (routine)
- May be set higher for specific purposes
- Lower LFF = more slow activity visible
- Higher LFF = less slow activity visible

### Typical Setting: 0.1–0.3 Hz
- **Typical setting: 0.1–0.3 Hz (routine)**
- Allows delta activity to be seen
- Prevents excessive baseline drift
- Standard for routine EEG
- May be adjusted for specific needs

### Effects of Raising LFF

#### Attenuates Delta
- **Attenuates delta:** Reduces delta activity visibility
- Delta activity becomes smaller
- May disappear entirely
- Can mask pathologic slowing
- Critical for encephalopathy detection

#### Masks Diffuse Slowing
- **Masks diffuse slowing:** Can hide encephalopathy
- Diffuse slowing may not be visible
- EEG may appear normal
- False-negative interpretation
- Critical error

#### Flattens Baseline Drift
- **Flattens baseline drift:** Reduces baseline movement
- Baseline appears more stable
- May be desirable for some recordings
- But may hide important slow activity
- Trade-off between stability and visibility

### ABRET Emphasis
- **High LFF can falsely normalize encephalopathy**
- Encephalopathy may not be visible
- EEG may appear normal
- False interpretation
- Must check LFF before interpreting

### Best Practice
- Use low LFF (0.1–0.3 Hz) for routine
- Check LFF before interpreting
- Know that high LFF masks slowing
- Document LFF in report

## 3. High-Frequency Filter (HFF)

### Controls Fast-Frequency Cutoff
- **Controls fast-frequency cutoff:** Removes frequencies above cutoff
- Typical setting: 35–70 Hz (routine)
- May be set lower for artifact reduction
- Higher HFF = more fast activity visible
- Lower HFF = less fast activity visible

### Typical Setting: 35–70 Hz
- **Typical setting: 35–70 Hz (routine)**
- Allows spikes to be seen
- Reduces muscle artifact
- Standard for routine EEG
- May be adjusted for specific needs

### Effects of Lowering HFF

#### Attenuates Spikes
- **Attenuates spikes:** Reduces spike visibility
- Spikes become smaller
- May be missed
- Can mask epileptiform activity
- Critical for epilepsy detection

#### Smooths Sharp Waves
- **Smooths sharp waves:** Makes sharp waves less sharp
- Sharp waves become rounded
- May be missed or misidentified
- Can mask epileptiform activity
- Critical error

#### Reduces Muscle Artifact
- **Reduces muscle artifact:** May be desirable
- Muscle artifact becomes smaller
- May improve signal quality
- But may also hide spikes
- Trade-off between artifact and signal

### ABRET Trap
- **Excessively low HFF can hide epileptiform activity**
- Spikes may not be visible
- Epileptiform activity may be missed
- False-negative interpretation
- Must check HFF before interpreting

### Best Practice
- Use appropriate HFF (35–70 Hz) for routine
- Check HFF before interpreting
- Know that low HFF masks spikes
- Document HFF in report

## 4. Sensitivity (Gain)

### Measured in µV/mm
- **Measured in µV/mm:** Standard unit
- Lower number = higher sensitivity
- Higher number = lower sensitivity
- Typical: 7.5–10 µV/mm (routine)
- May be adjusted for specific needs

### Lower Number = Higher Sensitivity
- **Lower number = higher sensitivity:** Important concept
- 5 µV/mm = higher sensitivity (larger display)
- 10 µV/mm = lower sensitivity (smaller display)
- Must understand this relationship
- Common ABRET trap

### Effects

#### High Sensitivity
- **High sensitivity (lower µV/mm):**
- **Larger waveforms:** Everything appears larger
- **Increased artifact visibility:** Artifacts more prominent
- **Better for low-amplitude signals:** Small signals more visible
- **May be too sensitive:** Can be overwhelming

#### Low Sensitivity
- **Low sensitivity (higher µV/mm):**
- **Smaller waveforms:** Everything appears smaller
- **Possible loss of detail:** Small signals may be missed
- **Reduced artifact visibility:** Artifacts less prominent
- **May miss abnormalities:** Important findings may be missed

### Best Practice
- Use standard sensitivity (7.5–10 µV/mm) for routine
- Adjust for specific needs
- Understand sensitivity effects
- Document sensitivity in report

## 5. Time Constants (Analog Concept)

### Relates to LFF Behavior
- **Relates to LFF behavior:** Analog equivalent
- Time constant determines LFF behavior
- Short time constant = high LFF
- Long time constant = low LFF
- Understanding helps with filter concepts

### Short Time Constant → Loss of Slow Activity
- **Short time constant → loss of slow activity**
- Similar to high LFF
- Slow activity is attenuated
- May mask pathologic slowing
- Must understand relationship

### Long Time Constant → Baseline Instability
- **Long time constant → baseline instability**
- Similar to low LFF
- More slow activity visible
- Baseline may drift more
- Trade-off between visibility and stability

### Best Practice
- Understand time constant concept
- Know relationship to LFF
- Apply to filter understanding
- Use for interpretation

## 6. Filter Effects Summary Table

| Setting Change | EEG Effect | Risk |
|----------------|------------|------|
| **Raise LFF** | Loss of delta | Miss encephalopathy |
| **Lower HFF** | Smooth spikes | Miss epileptiform |
| **Lower sensitivity** | Smaller waves | Miss abnormalities |
| **Raise sensitivity** | Larger waves | Increased artifacts |
| **Short time constant** | Loss of slow activity | Miss slowing |
| **Long time constant** | Baseline drift | Stability issues |

### Key Distinctions

#### Filter vs Sensitivity
- **Filter:** Affects frequency content (what frequencies are visible)
- **Sensitivity:** Affects amplitude display (how large waveforms appear)
- Different effects
- Both important
- Must understand both

### Best Practice
- Memorize filter effects
- Understand sensitivity effects
- Know risks of improper settings
- Always verify settings

## 7. Common ABRET Exam Traps

### Trap 1: Confusing Sensitivity with Amplitude
- **Reality:** Sensitivity is display setting, amplitude is signal property
- **Trap:** May think sensitivity changes actual amplitude
- **Solution:** Understand that sensitivity only affects display
- **ABRET focus:** Sensitivity vs amplitude distinction

### Trap 2: Attributing Filter Effects to Pathology
- **Reality:** Filter effects are technical, not pathologic
- **Trap:** May call filter effects as abnormal
- **Solution:** Always check filter settings first
- **ABRET focus:** Technical vs pathologic distinction

### Trap 3: Forgetting Default Settings
- **Reality:** Default settings are important reference
- **Trap:** May not know standard settings
- **Solution:** Memorize standard settings (LFF 0.1–0.3 Hz, HFF 35–70 Hz, Sensitivity 7.5–10 µV/mm)
- **ABRET focus:** Standard settings knowledge

### Trap 4: Ignoring Filter Settings During Interpretation
- **Reality:** Filter settings affect interpretation
- **Trap:** May interpret without checking settings
- **Solution:** Always verify settings before interpreting
- **ABRET focus:** Settings verification

### Trap 5: Not Understanding Sensitivity Relationship
- **Reality:** Lower number = higher sensitivity
- **Trap:** May confuse the relationship
- **Solution:** Memorize: lower µV/mm = higher sensitivity
- **ABRET focus:** Sensitivity relationship

## 8. Case-Based Example

### Scenario
**Clinical Setting:** ICU EEG for encephalopathy  
**Problem:** EEG appears normal despite clinical encephalopathy  
**Observation:** No slowing visible on EEG  
**Question:** What could cause this?

### Hidden Issue
- **LFF set too high**
- LFF may be set at 5 Hz or higher
- Slow activity is being filtered out
- Encephalopathy not visible
- False-normal appearance

### Correct Action
- **Lower LFF and reassess**
- Lower LFF to 0.1–0.3 Hz
- Reassess EEG for slowing
- Encephalopathy may now be visible
- Correct interpretation

### Teaching Point
- **Always verify filter settings before interpretation**
- Settings must be checked first
- Cannot interpret without knowing settings
- Settings can create false appearances
- Essential step in interpretation

### ABRET Application
- Given normal-appearing EEG in encephalopathy → check LFF
- Given missed epileptiform activity → check HFF
- Given interpretation question → verify settings first
- Must know standard settings and effects
