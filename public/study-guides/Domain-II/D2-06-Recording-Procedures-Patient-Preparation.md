## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### Quality EEG Begins Before Electrodes Are Applied
- **Quality EEG begins before electrodes are applied**
- Preparation is essential
- Cannot fix poor preparation later
- Good preparation = good data
- Poor preparation = poor data

### Patient Cooperation Directly Affects Signal Quality
- **Patient cooperation directly affects signal quality**
- Cooperative patient = better signal
- Uncooperative patient = more artifacts
- Clear instructions improve cooperation
- Patient comfort improves cooperation

### Preparation Errors Lead to Artifact and Misinterpretation
- **Preparation errors lead to artifact and misinterpretation**
- Poor preparation creates artifacts
- Artifacts can mimic pathology
- May lead to false interpretation
- Prevention is better than correction

### Key Principle
- **Good preparation prevents poor data**
- Invest time in preparation
- Preparation saves time later
- Quality preparation = quality data
- Cannot compensate for poor preparation

### Practical Application
- Always prepare thoroughly
- Follow standardized workflow
- Document preparation steps
- Address issues before recording

## 3. Patient Preparation Steps

### Ensure

#### Clean Scalp

- Hair products create barriers
- Must remove before application
- May need to clean scalp

#### Position Patient Comfortably
- **Position patient comfortably:** Reduces movement

- Support head and neck
- Reduce muscle tension
- Prevent discomfort

#### Remove Metallic Accessories
- **Remove metallic accessories:** Prevent artifacts
- Jewelry, hairpins, etc.
- May create artifacts
- May interfere with recording
- Remove before recording

### ABRET Emphasis
- **Clear patient instructions reduce movement artifact**
- Good instructions = less movement
- Poor instructions = more movement
- Clear communication is essential
- Reduces artifacts

### Best Practice
- Prepare scalp properly
- Position patient comfortably
- Remove interfering items
- Give clear instructions

## 4. Pre-Recording Equipment Checks

### Verify

#### Impedance Levels
- **Impedance levels:** Essential for quality
- Check all electrodes
- Target: <5 kΩ (ideal)
- Acceptable: <10 kΩ
- Document impedance levels

#### Electrode Connections
- **Electrode connections:** Ensure all connected
- Verify all electrodes connected
- Check for loose connections
- Test connections
- Fix problems before recording

#### Amplifier and Filter Settings
- **Amplifier and filter settings:** Verify correct settings
- Sensitivity: 7.5–10 µV/mm (routine)
- LFF: 0.5–1 Hz (routine)
- HFF: 35–70 Hz (routine)
- Notch: Off (unless needed)

#### Sampling Rate and Timebase
- **Sampling rate and timebase:** Verify correct settings
- Sampling rate: ≥200 Hz
- Timebase: 30 mm/s (routine)
- Verify settings match protocol
- Document settings

### Best Practice
- Check all equipment before recording
- Verify all settings
- Document equipment status
- Fix problems before starting

## 5. During Recording

### Monitor

#### Patient State
- **Patient state:** Essential for interpretation
- Wake, drowsy, sleep
- Document state changes
- Note transitions
- Important for interpretation

#### Artifacts
- **Artifacts:** Identify and document
- Movement artifacts
- Muscle artifacts
- Eye movement artifacts
- Other artifacts

#### Electrode Stability
- **Electrode stability:** Monitor continuously
- Check for electrode pops
- Monitor impedance
- Watch for disconnections
- Fix problems immediately

### Provide Instructions

#### Eye Opening/Closure
- **Eye opening/closure:** Test reactivity
- "Open your eyes" (test alpha reactivity)
- "Close your eyes" (restore alpha)
- Document reactivity
- Essential for background assessment

#### Activation Procedures
- **Activation procedures:** As indicated
- Hyperventilation (if appropriate)
- Photic stimulation (if appropriate)
- Sleep (if indicated)
- Follow protocols

### Best Practice
- Monitor continuously
- Provide clear instructions
- Document patient state
- Address problems immediately

- Patient not properly instructed
- Patient didn't understand what to do
- Patient uncomfortable or anxious
- Poor communication

### Corrective Action
- **Re-explain procedure and reposition patient**

- Address patient concerns
- Improve communication

### Teaching Point
- **Communication is part of EEG technique**
- Good communication = good data
- Poor communication = poor data
- Communication is essential skill
- Must communicate effectively

### ABRET Application
