## 1. Core Concepts (Must Know)

### Signal Display
- **EEG displays voltage differences** between electrodes
- Not absolute voltage, but relative differences
- Montage determines which electrodes are compared
- Same signal appears differently in different montages

### Montage Determines
- **Polarity** (which direction signal deflects)
- **Amplitude distribution** (how large signals appear)
- **Apparent localization** (where activity appears maximal)
- **Artifact behavior** (how artifacts appear)

### Key Principle
- **Montage does not change brain activity, only how it is displayed**
- Same cerebral activity looks different in different montages
- Must use multiple montages for accurate interpretation
- Montage selection affects what you can see

### Practical Application
- Always review EEG in multiple montages
- Compare findings across montages before concluding
- Understand how montage affects appearance
- Use appropriate montage for specific questions

## 2. Common EEG Montages

### Longitudinal Bipolar

#### Structure
- **Electrodes linked anterior → posterior**
- Chain of connections along same hemisphere
- Example: Fp1-F3, F3-C3, C3-P3, P3-O1
- Creates "chain" of connections

#### Good For
- **Phase reversal** (localization of focal activity)
- **Lateralization** (left vs right comparison)
- **Artifact identification** (artifacts behave differently)
- **Focal abnormalities** (clear phase reversals)

#### Characteristics
- Clear phase reversals at focal sites
- Good for lateralization
- Less affected by reference contamination
- Standard for routine EEG

### Transverse Bipolar

#### Structure
- **Electrodes linked left → right**
- Connections across hemispheres
- Example: Fp1-Fp2, F3-F4, C3-C4, P3-P4
- Highlights asymmetry

#### Good For
- **Asymmetry detection** (left vs right comparison)
- **Lateralized abnormalities** (unilateral findings)
- **Hemispheric comparison** (side-to-side differences)
- **Artifact discrimination** (lateralized artifacts)

#### Characteristics
- Excellent for asymmetry
- Highlights lateralized findings
- Less useful for precise localization
- Good complement to longitudinal bipolar

### Referential

#### Structure
- **Each electrode compared to a common reference**
- Reference may be: linked ears, average, Cz, etc.
- Example: Fp1-A1, F3-A1, C3-A1, P3-A1
- All channels share same reference

#### Good For
- **Absolute amplitude** (true amplitude at each electrode)
- **Focal abnormalities** (clear amplitude at focal site)
- **Widespread activity** (generalized patterns)
- **Reference-independent findings** (if reference is "quiet")

#### Characteristics
- Shows true amplitude at each electrode
- Affected by reference contamination
- Good for focal abnormalities
- Requires "quiet" reference

### Average Reference

#### Structure
- **Each electrode compared to average of all electrodes**
- Reference = average of all active electrodes
- Example: Fp1-AVG, F3-AVG, C3-AVG, P3-AVG
- Reference is calculated, not physical electrode

#### Good For
- **Focal abnormalities** (if widespread activity)
- **Generalized patterns** (reduces reference contamination)
- **Research applications** (standardized reference)
- **Complex localization** (multiple focal sites)

#### Characteristics
- Reduces reference contamination
- Good for focal abnormalities
- May mask widespread activity
- Requires all electrodes functioning

## 3. Phase Reversal

### Definition
- **Occurs when polarity changes between adjacent channels**
- Upward deflection in one channel, downward in adjacent
- Indicates site of maximal voltage difference
- Localizes focal abnormality

### Mechanism
- Focal activity creates voltage gradient
- Maximum voltage at focal site
- Polarity reverses at site of maximum
- Phase reversal marks the focal site

### ABRET Emphasis
- **Phase reversal helps localize focal abnormalities**
- Must identify phase reversal in bipolar montages
- Phase reversal indicates site of maximum activity
- Critical for accurate localization

### Recognition
- Look for polarity change between adjacent channels
- Phase reversal occurs at site of maximum activity
- Must be in bipolar montage (not referential)
- Compare with referential montage for confirmation

### Clinical Application
- Focal spikes show phase reversal
- Focal slowing may show phase reversal
- Phase reversal localizes epileptiform activity
- Essential for surgical planning

---

## 4. Reference Contamination

### Definition
- **Reference electrode contains cerebral activity**
- Reference is not truly "inactive"
- Reference activity affects all channels
- Can mask or create false abnormalities

### Effects
- **Can mask abnormalities** (if reference has similar activity)
- **Can create false localization** (if reference has focal activity)
- **Can obscure findings** (if reference is contaminated)
- **Affects all referential channels** (all share same reference)

### ABRET Trap
- **A "quiet" reference is rarely truly inactive**
- Even "quiet" references may have some activity
- Reference contamination is common
- Must consider reference when interpreting referential montages

### Common References

#### Linked Ears (A1-A2)
- Often used but may be contaminated
- Ear electrodes may pick up temporal activity
- Can mask temporal abnormalities
- Not truly "quiet"

#### Average Reference
- Calculated from all electrodes
- Reduces but doesn't eliminate contamination
- Good for focal abnormalities
- May mask widespread activity

#### Cz Reference
- Central electrode as reference
- May be contaminated by central activity
- Good for some applications
- Not ideal for central abnormalities

### Best Practice
- Use bipolar montages to reduce reference effects
- Compare referential with bipolar findings
- Understand that no reference is perfect
- Consider reference contamination in interpretation

## 5. Montage Comparison Strategy

### Always Review EEG In
- **Bipolar montage** (longitudinal and/or transverse)
- **Referential montage** (at least one type)
- **Compare findings** before concluding localization
- **Use multiple montages** for confirmation

### Comparison Process
1. **Identify abnormality in one montage**
2. **Check same abnormality in other montages**
3. **Compare localization** across montages
4. **Confirm findings** are consistent
5. **Interpret** only after montage comparison

### True Abnormalities
- **Persist across montages** (appear in multiple montages)
- **Show consistent localization** (same location in different montages)
- **Have appropriate morphology** (consistent appearance)
- **Correlate with clinical findings**

### Artifacts
- **May change with montage** (different appearance)
- **May disappear in some montages** (montage-dependent)
- **May show inconsistent localization** (different locations)
- **Do not correlate with clinical findings**

### Clinical Application
- Epileptiform discharges appear in multiple montages
- True slowing persists across montages
- Artifacts often change with montage
- Montage comparison helps distinguish artifact from pathology

## 6. Common ABRET Exam Traps

### Trap 1: Over-Reliance on a Single Montage
- **Reality:** Must use multiple montages for accurate interpretation
- Single montage may miss or mislocalize abnormalities
- Always compare findings across montages
- No single montage is perfect

### Trap 2: Misinterpreting Polarity Without Context
- **Reality:** Polarity depends on montage and electrode position
- Upward deflection doesn't always mean negative
- Must understand montage structure to interpret polarity
- Context is essential for polarity interpretation

### Trap 3: Ignoring Reference Contamination
- **Reality:** Reference contamination is common
- Can mask or create false abnormalities
- Must consider reference when using referential montages
- Bipolar montages reduce reference effects

### Trap 4: Confusing Artifact for Phase Reversal
- **Reality:** Artifacts can create apparent phase reversals
- Must verify phase reversal in multiple montages
- Artifacts often change with montage
- True phase reversal is consistent across montages

### Trap 5: Not Comparing Montages
- **Reality:** Must compare findings across montages
- Single montage interpretation is incomplete
- Comparison confirms true abnormalities
- Always use multiple montages for localization

## 7. Clinical Correlation

### Epileptiform Discharges
- **Localize best when seen across multiple montages**
- Phase reversal in bipolar montages
- Clear amplitude in referential montages
- Consistent localization across montages

### Artifact Behavior
- **Often changes with montage selection**
- May appear in one montage but not others
- May show inconsistent localization
- Montage comparison helps identify artifacts

### Focal Abnormalities
- **Require montage comparison for accurate localization**
- Phase reversal localizes site of maximum
- Referential montage confirms focal nature
- Multiple montages increase confidence

### Best Practice
- Always use multiple montages
- Compare findings across montages
- Understand how montage affects appearance
- Use appropriate montage for specific questions

## 8. Case-Based Example

### Scenario
**Clinical Setting:** Routine EEG for seizure evaluation  
**Bipolar Montage Finding:** Spike appears maximal at F7  
**Clinical Question:** Is this a true temporal spike?

### Montage Comparison
- **Bipolar montage:** Phase reversal at F7-T3
- **Referential montage:** Clear spike at F7, smaller at T3
- **Transverse bipolar:** Asymmetric, left greater than right
- **All montages confirm:** Focal left temporal spike

### Interpretation
- **True epileptiform activity** (persists across montages)
- **Localized to left temporal region** (consistent across montages)
- **Phase reversal confirms** focal nature
- **Referential montage confirms** amplitude and distribution

### Teaching Point
- **True epileptiform activity persists across montages**
- Must compare findings across montages
- Phase reversal helps localize
- Multiple montages increase diagnostic confidence

### ABRET Application
- Given finding in one montage → check other montages
- Given phase reversal → identify site of maximum
- Given referential finding → compare with bipolar
- Understand that montage comparison is essential
