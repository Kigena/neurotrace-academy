## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### Activation Procedures Alter Cortical Excitability
- **Activation procedures alter cortical excitability**
- They modify brain activity to enhance diagnostic yield
- Different procedures affect different brain regions
- Purpose is to provoke or enhance abnormalities

### They Increase EEG Diagnostic Sensitivity
- **They increase EEG diagnostic sensitivity**
- Help detect abnormalities that may not be visible at rest
- Enhance interictal epileptiform discharges
- Improve diagnostic accuracy

### Responses May Be

#### Normal Physiologic
- **Normal physiologic responses:** Expected, non-pathologic changes
- Examples: HV-induced slowing, photic driving
- Do not indicate pathology
- Must be recognized as normal

#### Abnormal Epileptiform
- **Abnormal epileptiform responses:** Pathologic, indicate seizure risk
- Examples: HV-induced spike-and-wave, photic-induced discharges
- Indicate increased seizure risk
- Require clinical correlation

### Key Principle
- **Activation enhances abnormalities; it does not create epilepsy**
- Activation reveals existing abnormalities
- Does not cause epilepsy
- Negative activation does not exclude epilepsy

### Practical Application
- Always perform activation procedures when appropriate
- Recognize normal vs abnormal responses
- Document activation responses accurately
- Correlate with clinical presentation

## 2. Hyperventilation (HV)

### Physiologic Effects

#### Mechanism
- **↓ CO₂ → cerebral vasoconstriction**
- Hyperventilation reduces CO₂ (hypocapnia)
- Causes cerebral vasoconstriction
- Reduces cerebral blood flow

#### Result
- **Produces generalized slowing (especially children)**
- Generalized theta/delta activity
- More prominent in children
- Usually symmetric

### Normal EEG Response

#### Characteristics
- **Symmetric, generalized theta/delta**
- Bilateral, symmetric slowing
- Generalized distribution
- No epileptiform discharges

#### Timing
- **Resolves after HV ends**
- Slowing appears during HV
- Resolves within 1-2 minutes after stopping
- Background returns to baseline

#### Age Considerations
- **More prominent in children:** Children show more slowing
- **Less prominent in adults:** Adults show less slowing
- **Age-dependent:** Response varies with age
- **Normal variant:** HV-induced slowing is normal

### Abnormal Response

#### Generalized Spike-and-Wave (Absence Epilepsy)
- **3 Hz spike-and-wave:** Classic pattern for absence epilepsy
- **Generalized distribution:** Bilateral, synchronous
- **Frontal predominance:** Often frontally predominant
- **Clinical significance:** Suggests absence epilepsy

#### Other Abnormal Patterns
- **Focal epileptiform:** May enhance focal discharges
- **Asymmetric slowing:** May indicate focal pathology
- **Persistent slowing:** May indicate encephalopathy

### ABRET Emphasis
- **HV-induced slowing in children is usually normal**
- Must not be called abnormal in children
- Only epileptiform responses are abnormal
- Age-appropriate interpretation is critical

### Safety Considerations
- **Contraindications:** Sickle cell disease, severe cardiac disease, severe respiratory disease
- **Duration:** Usually 3-5 minutes
- **Monitoring:** Watch for patient distress
- **Stop if:** Patient becomes uncomfortable or shows signs of distress

## 3. Photic Stimulation (IPS)

### Physiologic Response

#### Photic Driving
- **Occipital rhythm time-locked to flash rate**
- Occipital rhythm follows flash frequency
- Time-locked to flash rate (1:1 or harmonics)
- Symmetric and posterior dominant

#### Characteristics
- **Symmetric and posterior dominant**
- Bilateral, symmetric response
- Maximal over occipital regions
- Normal physiologic response

#### Frequency Response
- **1:1 driving:** Occipital rhythm matches flash rate
- **Harmonic driving:** Occipital rhythm at multiples of flash rate
- **Subharmonic driving:** Occipital rhythm at fractions of flash rate
- **Normal variants:** All are normal

### Abnormal Response

#### Photic-Induced Epileptiform Discharges
- **Spikes or spike-and-wave:** Epileptiform discharges during photic
- **Time-locked to flash:** Discharges occur during photic stimulation
- **Generalized or focal:** May be generalized or focal
- **Clinical significance:** Indicates photosensitive epilepsy

#### Photosensitive Epilepsy Patterns
- **Generalized spike-and-wave:** Most common pattern
- **Polyspike-and-wave:** Less common pattern
- **Focal discharges:** May occur in some cases
- **Clinical correlation:** Correlates with photosensitive seizures

### ABRET Trap
- **Photic driving ≠ photic-induced epilepsy**
- Photic driving is normal
- Photic-induced epileptiform is abnormal
- Must differentiate between the two

### Technique
- **Flash rates:** Usually 1-30 Hz
- **Duration:** Usually 10 seconds per frequency
- **Eyes closed:** Usually performed with eyes closed
- **Documentation:** Must document responses at each frequency

## 4. Sleep & Sleep Deprivation

### Sleep Increases

#### Interictal Epileptiform Discharges
- **Sleep increases interictal epileptiform discharges**
- More discharges seen in sleep than wake
- Especially in light sleep (Stage 1-2)
- Important for focal epilepsy

#### Mechanism
- **Sleep enhances cortical excitability**
- Sleep stages affect cortical activity
- Light sleep is most activating
- Deep sleep may suppress some discharges

### Sleep Deprivation

#### Enhances Diagnostic Yield
- **Sleep deprivation enhances diagnostic yield**
- Increases likelihood of capturing abnormalities
- Improves sleep quality during recording
- Common in focal epilepsy

#### Common in Focal Epilepsy
- **Common in focal epilepsy**
- Especially temporal lobe epilepsy
- Helps capture interictal discharges
- Improves diagnostic sensitivity

### Sleep Stages and Activation
- **Light sleep (Stage 1-2):** Most activating
- **Deep sleep (Stage 3-4):** May suppress some discharges
- **REM sleep:** Variable effects
- **Sleep transitions:** Often show increased activity

### Clinical Application
- **Always attempt sleep:** If clinically indicated
- **Sleep deprivation:** Consider if initial EEG negative
- **Document sleep stages:** Important for interpretation
- **Correlate with clinical:** Sleep-activated discharges are significant

## 5. Activation vs Artifact

| Feature | Activation Effect | Artifact |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| **Time-locked** | Yes | Often irregular |
| **Symmetry** | Usually symmetric | Variable |
| **Reversibility** | Yes | Inconsistent |
| **Distribution** | Physiologic | Non-physiologic |
| **Clinical correlation** | Yes | No |
| **Reproducibility** | Reproducible | Variable |

### Key Distinctions

#### Time-Locked
- **Activation effect:** Time-locked to procedure (HV, photic)
- **Artifact:** Often irregular, not time-locked
- **Timing:** Activation effects occur during/after procedure
- **Pattern:** Activation effects follow predictable patterns

#### Symmetry
- **Activation effect:** Usually symmetric (bilateral)
- **Artifact:** Variable symmetry
- **Distribution:** Activation effects are physiologic
- **Consistency:** Activation effects are consistent

#### Reversibility
- **Activation effect:** Reversible (stops when procedure stops)
- **Artifact:** May persist or be inconsistent
- **Resolution:** Activation effects resolve after procedure
- **Persistence:** Artifacts may persist

## 6. Common ABRET Exam Traps

### Trap 1: Calling HV-Induced Slowing Abnormal in Children
- **Reality:** HV-induced slowing is normal in children
- **Trap:** May call normal slowing as abnormal
- **Solution:** Recognize that HV-induced slowing is normal
- **ABRET focus:** Age-appropriate interpretation

### Trap 2: Confusing Photic Driving with Epileptiform Response
- **Reality:** Photic driving is normal, epileptiform is abnormal
- **Trap:** May call photic driving as epileptiform
- **Solution:** Look for epileptiform morphology (spikes, spike-and-wave)
- **ABRET focus:** Differentiation of normal vs abnormal

### Trap 3: Ignoring State and Age
- **Reality:** Activation responses vary with age and state
- **Trap:** May not consider age or state when interpreting
- **Solution:** Always consider age and state
- **ABRET focus:** Context-dependent interpretation

### Trap 4: Overcalling Activation-Related Changes
- **Reality:** Not all activation-induced changes are abnormal
- **Trap:** May call normal activation responses as abnormal
- **Solution:** Learn normal activation responses
- **ABRET focus:** Recognition of normal responses

### Trap 5: Not Documenting Activation Responses
- **Reality:** Activation responses must be documented
- **Trap:** May not document activation responses
- **Solution:** Always document activation responses
- **ABRET focus:** Proper documentation

## 8. Case-Based Example

### Scenario
**Clinical Setting:** Routine EEG for staring spells  
**EEG Finding:** Generalized spike-and-wave during HV  
**Clinical History:** Brief staring spells, normal development  
**Pattern:** 3 Hz generalized spike-and-wave, frontally predominant, during HV

### Interpretation
- **Suggestive of absence epilepsy**
- HV-induced 3 Hz spike-and-wave
- Generalized distribution
- Consistent with absence epilepsy

### Teaching Point
- **HV is particularly useful in generalized epilepsies**
- HV enhances generalized epileptiform discharges
- 3 Hz spike-and-wave is classic for absence epilepsy
- Activation helps confirm diagnosis

### ABRET Application
- Given HV-induced spike-and-wave → recognize as abnormal
- Given 3 Hz frequency → think absence epilepsy
- Given generalized distribution → think generalized epilepsy
- Must correlate with clinical presentation
