# NeuroTrace Study Guide

**Domain:** Domain III – EEG Patterns & Clinical Correlation  
**Section:** Focal vs Generalized EEG Patterns  
**Style:** Classification-focused, applied, exam-oriented

---

## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### Classification by Distribution
- **EEG abnormalities are classified by distribution** (focal vs generalized)
- Distribution is fundamental to interpretation
- Determines localization and etiology
- Guides clinical correlation

### Distribution Guides
- **Localization** (where the abnormality is)
- **Etiology** (what causes it)
- **Clinical correlation** (what it means clinically)
- **Treatment decisions** (how to manage it)

### Key Principle
- **Distribution is as important as morphology**
- Must classify by distribution before interpreting
- Focal and generalized have different implications
- Correct classification is essential

### Practical Application
- Always classify distribution first
- Use distribution to guide interpretation
- Understand implications of focal vs generalized
- Apply localization logic correctly

## 2. Focal EEG Abnormalities

### Definition
- **Limited to one region or hemisphere**
- Localized to specific brain area
- May be unilateral or asymmetric
- Suggests focal pathology

### Common Findings

#### Focal Slowing
- **Theta or delta activity** over specific region
- Localized to one lobe or hemisphere
- Suggests focal cortical dysfunction
- Often indicates structural pathology

#### Focal Epileptiform Discharges
- **Spikes or sharp waves** over specific region
- Localized to one area
- Suggests focal cortical irritability
- May guide surgical planning

#### Focal Attenuation
- **Reduced amplitude** over specific region
- Localized amplitude reduction
- Suggests focal cortical dysfunction
- May indicate structural lesion

### Clinical Significance
- **Often indicate structural pathology** (lesion, scar, etc.)
- May guide imaging studies (MRI, CT)
- Important for surgical planning
- Suggests focal epilepsy

### ABRET Emphasis
- **Focal slowing strongly suggests cortical dysfunction**
- Must localize accurately
- Focal patterns warrant structural evaluation
- Localization guides clinical management

### Common Locations
- **Temporal:** Most common (temporal lobe epilepsy)
- **Frontal:** Second most common
- **Parietal/Occipital:** Less common
- **Rolandic:** Benign rolandic epilepsy (children)

## 3. Generalized EEG Abnormalities

### Definition
- **Involve both hemispheres simultaneously**
- Bilateral, synchronous (or nearly synchronous)
- Widespread distribution
- Suggests diffuse or systemic process

### Common Findings

#### Generalized Slowing
- **Diffuse theta or delta activity**
- Bilateral, symmetric (or asymmetric)
- Suggests diffuse cortical dysfunction
- Often indicates metabolic or toxic cause

#### Generalized Spike-and-Wave
- **Bilateral, synchronous spike-and-wave**
- Generalized distribution
- Suggests generalized epilepsy syndromes
- Idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE)

#### Generalized Attenuation
- **Reduced amplitude bilaterally**
- Widespread amplitude reduction
- Suggests diffuse cortical dysfunction
- May indicate severe encephalopathy

### Clinical Significance
- **Often reflect diffuse or metabolic processes**
- May indicate systemic causes (metabolic, toxic, infectious)
- Suggests generalized epilepsy syndromes
- Different treatment approach than focal

### Common Causes
- **Metabolic:** Hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy
- **Toxic:** Medications, drugs, toxins
- **Infectious:** Encephalitis, meningitis
- **Generalized epilepsy:** IGE syndromes

## 4. Asymmetry & Lateralization

### Asymmetric Generalized Patterns

#### Characteristics
- **Bilateral but asymmetric** (one side more prominent)
- Both hemispheres involved but unequally
- Asymmetry may be subtle or marked
- Clinically significant

#### Clinical Significance
- **May indicate focal dominance** (one side more affected)
- Persistent asymmetry is clinically significant
- May suggest focal onset with secondary generalization
- Important for syndrome classification

#### Interpretation
- Degree of asymmetry matters
- Persistent asymmetry suggests focal component
- Transient asymmetry may be less significant
- Must correlate with clinical findings

### ABRET Trap
- **Symmetry does not equal normality**
- Symmetric patterns can still be abnormal
- Must assess morphology and amplitude, not just symmetry
- Generalized patterns can be symmetric but abnormal

### Lateralization Logic
- **Unilateral = focal** (one hemisphere only)
- **Bilateral symmetric = generalized** (both hemispheres equally)
- **Bilateral asymmetric = generalized with focal component** (both hemispheres, one more affected)
- **Degree of asymmetry** guides interpretation

## 5. Focal vs Generalized Epilepsy

| EEG Pattern | Likely Classification | Clinical Implication |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Temporal spikes** | Focal epilepsy | Temporal lobe epilepsy, may need imaging |
| **3 Hz spike-and-wave** | Generalized epilepsy | Absence epilepsy, IGE syndrome |
| **Diffuse slowing** | Global dysfunction | Metabolic, toxic, or diffuse process |
| **Lateralized slowing** | Focal lesion | Structural pathology, may need imaging |
| **Frontal spikes** | Focal epilepsy | Frontal lobe epilepsy |
| **Generalized polyspikes** | Generalized epilepsy | Myoclonic epilepsy, JME |

### Key Distinctions

#### Focal Epilepsy
- **Focal EEG patterns** (localized abnormalities)
- **Focal seizure semiology** (localized symptoms)
- **May have structural correlation** (lesion, scar)
- **Surgical candidate** (if medication-resistant)

#### Generalized Epilepsy
- **Generalized EEG patterns** (bilateral abnormalities)
- **Generalized seizure semiology** (bilateral symptoms)
- **Often idiopathic** (no structural cause)
- **Medical management** (usually not surgical)

### Clinical Application
- EEG pattern guides epilepsy classification
- Classification guides treatment decisions
- Focal patterns warrant imaging
- Generalized patterns suggest systemic causes

## 6. Common ABRET Exam Traps

### Trap 1: Misclassifying Asymmetric Generalized Slowing
- **Reality:** Asymmetric generalized is still generalized
- May indicate focal component but is generalized pattern
- Must classify as generalized, note asymmetry
- Asymmetry doesn't make it focal

### Trap 2: Overlocalizing Poorly Formed Abnormalities
- **Reality:** Not all abnormalities can be precisely localized
- Some patterns are poorly localized (parietal, deep frontal)
- Don't force localization when unclear
- "Poorly localized" is acceptable classification

### Trap 3: Ignoring Montage Effects
- **Reality:** Montage affects apparent distribution
- Must compare across montages before classifying
- Single montage may be misleading
- Always use multiple montages for classification

### Trap 4: Forgetting Clinical Context
- **Reality:** Clinical context guides classification
- Focal seizures + focal EEG = focal epilepsy
- Generalized seizures + generalized EEG = generalized epilepsy
- EEG must match clinical presentation

### Trap 5: Assuming All Bilateral Patterns are Generalized
- **Reality:** Bilateral doesn't always mean generalized
- Must assess synchrony and symmetry
- Bilateral independent = multifocal, not generalized
- Synchrony distinguishes generalized from multifocal

## 7. Clinical Correlation

### Focal Patterns Often Warrant Imaging
- **Focal slowing:** Suggests structural lesion, warrants MRI
- **Focal spikes:** May indicate structural pathology, consider imaging
- **Focal attenuation:** Suggests structural lesion, warrants imaging
- **Localization guides imaging** (where to look)

### Generalized Patterns Suggest Systemic Causes
- **Generalized slowing:** Metabolic, toxic, infectious causes
- **Generalized spike-and-wave:** Generalized epilepsy syndromes
- **Generalized attenuation:** Severe encephalopathy
- **Systemic evaluation** (labs, metabolic workup)

### EEG Findings Must Match Clinical Presentation
- **Focal EEG + focal seizures:** Consistent, supports focal epilepsy
- **Generalized EEG + generalized seizures:** Consistent, supports generalized epilepsy
- **Mismatch:** May indicate secondary generalization or misclassification
- **Always correlate** EEG with clinical findings

### Best Practice
- Classify distribution accurately
- Correlate with clinical presentation
- Use distribution to guide further evaluation
- Understand implications of focal vs generalized

## 8. Case-Based Example

### Scenario
**Clinical Setting:** Routine EEG for seizure evaluation  
**EEG Finding:** Bilateral slowing, left > right  
**Clinical History:** Focal impaired awareness seizures  
**Pattern:** Diffuse theta/delta, asymmetric, left hemisphere more affected

### Interpretation
- **Generalized slowing with focal predominance** (bilateral but asymmetric)
- Both hemispheres involved (generalized)
- Left hemisphere more affected (focal component)
- Suggests focal pathology with contralateral effects

### Teaching Point
- **Degree and persistence of asymmetry guide localization**
- Asymmetric generalized suggests focal component
- Must note both distribution (generalized) and asymmetry (focal component)
- Clinical correlation helps interpret significance

### ABRET Application
- Given asymmetric pattern → classify as generalized, note asymmetry
- Understand that asymmetry suggests focal component
- Know that degree of asymmetry matters
- Correlate with clinical findings
