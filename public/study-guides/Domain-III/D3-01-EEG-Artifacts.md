## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### Artifact Origin
- **Artifacts originate outside the brain**
- Non-cerebral signals that contaminate EEG
- Can be physiologic (body-generated) or non-physiologic (technical)
- Must be distinguished from true cerebral activity

### Artifact Types
- **Physiologic artifacts:** Generated by body (eye movement, muscle, ECG)
- **Non-physiologic artifacts:** Technical (60 Hz, electrode pop, movement)
- Both can mimic pathology
- Recognition prevents misdiagnosis

### Artifact Recognition Relies On
- **Morphology** (shape and appearance)
- **Distribution** (where it appears)
- **Reactivity** (how it responds to changes)
- **Montage behavior** (how it changes with montage)

### Key Principle
- **Cerebral activity obeys neurophysiologic rules; artifacts do not**
- True cerebral activity has consistent characteristics
- Artifacts often violate neurophysiologic rules
- Use this principle to distinguish artifact from pathology

### Practical Application
- Always assess for artifacts before interpreting pathology
- Compare findings across montages
- Observe reactivity to patient behavior
- Understand artifact characteristics

## 2. Common Physiologic Artifacts

### Eye Movement (EOG)

#### Characteristics
- **Slow rolling eye movements**
- **Frontal predominance** (maximum at Fp1, Fp2)
- **Phase reversal near FP electrodes**
- Bilateral, often synchronous
- Correlates with eye position

#### Recognition
- Maximum at frontal pole electrodes
- Phase reversal between Fp1/Fp2 and adjacent electrodes
- Slow, rolling morphology
- Changes with eye position
- Suppressed with eyes closed

#### Clinical Correlation
- Normal during wakefulness
- May mimic frontal slowing
- Can obscure frontal abnormalities
- Documented as normal variant

#### ABRET Application
- Must distinguish from frontal slowing
- Eye movement is artifact, not pathology
- Observe EOG channels if available
- Note reactivity to eye position

---

### Muscle (EMG)

#### Characteristics
- **Fast, irregular activity** (20-100+ Hz)
- **Increased with movement** (jaw clenching, talking, head movement)
- **Suppressed during sleep** (muscle tone decreases)
- High frequency, low amplitude (when filtered)
- Often asymmetric

#### Recognition
- Fast, spiky appearance
- Irregular, non-rhythmic
- Increases with movement
- Maximum near muscle groups (temporal, frontal)
- Suppressed during sleep

#### Clinical Correlation
- Common during wakefulness

## 4. Artifact vs Epileptiform Activity

| Feature | Artifact | Epileptiform |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Reactivity** | Changes with movement/behavior | Persists |
| **Distribution** | Often widespread | Focal |
| **Morphology** | Irregular, non-stereotyped | Stereotyped, consistent |
| **Montage behavior** | Inconsistent across montages | Consistent across montages |
| **Clinical correlation** | No correlation with symptoms | Correlates with clinical findings |
| **Frequency** | Variable | Consistent |
| **Amplitude** | Variable | Consistent |
| **Field** | May be widespread | Focal field |

### Key Distinctions

#### True Epileptiform Activity
- **Persists across montages** (consistent appearance)
- **Stereotyped morphology** (consistent shape)
- **Focal distribution** (localized field)
- **Correlates with clinical findings** (seizure semiology)
- **Follows neurophysiologic rules** (appropriate field, polarity)

#### Artifacts
- **May change with montage** (inconsistent appearance)
- **Irregular morphology** (variable shape)
- **May be widespread** (not localized)
- **No clinical correlation** (not related to symptoms)
- **Violates neurophysiologic rules** (inappropriate field, reactivity)

### ABRET Application
- Given pattern → identify artifact vs epileptiform
- Use montage comparison to distinguish
- Observe reactivity to patient behavior
- Correlate with clinical findings

## 5. Montage & Sensitivity Clues

### Artifact Often
- **Changes with montage** (different appearance in different montages)
- **Exaggerated by high sensitivity** (appears larger with higher sensitivity)
- **Inconsistent localization** (different location in different montages)
- **Widespread distribution** (affects multiple channels)
- **Reactive to technical changes** (changes with settings)

### True Cerebral Activity
- **Persists across montages** (consistent appearance)
- **Maintains morphology** (same shape in different montages)
- **Consistent localization** (same location across montages)
- **Focal distribution** (localized field)
- **Not reactive to technical changes** (unchanged by settings)

### Practical Application
- Always compare findings across montages
- Verify sensitivity settings
- Observe how pattern changes with montage
- Use montage comparison to confirm true activity

### ABRET Emphasis
- Montage comparison is essential
- Artifacts change with montage
- True activity persists across montages
- Sensitivity affects artifact appearance

## 6. Common ABRET Exam Traps

### Trap 1: Mislabeling Muscle Artifact as Fast Activity
- **Reality:** Muscle is artifact, not cerebral fast activity
- Muscle increases with movement, cerebral activity doesn't
- Muscle suppresses during sleep, cerebral activity persists
- Must observe reactivity to distinguish

### Trap 2: Confusing Eye Movement with Frontal Slowing
- **Reality:** Eye movement is artifact, not frontal pathology
- Eye movement changes with eye position, slowing doesn't
- Eye movement has phase reversal at FP, slowing doesn't
- Must observe EOG channels and reactivity

### Trap 3: Assuming Rhythmicity Implies Cerebral Origin
- **Reality:** Artifacts can be rhythmic (ECG, 60 Hz)
- Rhythmicity alone doesn't indicate cerebral origin
- Must consider source and distribution
- ECG and 60 Hz are rhythmic but artifacts

### Trap 4: Ignoring Clinical Context
- **Reality:** Clinical context helps distinguish artifact from pathology
- Artifacts don't correlate with clinical findings
- True pathology correlates with symptoms
- Always consider clinical presentation

### Trap 5: Not Comparing Montages
- **Reality:** Must compare findings across montages
- Artifacts often change with montage
- True activity persists across montages
- Single montage interpretation is incomplete

## 7. Clinical Correlation

### Artifact Misinterpretation Can Lead To
- **False epilepsy diagnosis** (artifacts mistaken for spikes)
- **Unnecessary treatment** (medications for artifact)
- **Incorrect localization** (artifact mistaken for focal activity)
- **Missed pathology** (artifacts obscuring true abnormalities)

### Pediatric EEGs
- **Especially artifact-prone** (movement, muscle, eye movement)
- Children move more, creating more artifacts
- Normal variants can mimic artifacts
- Requires careful artifact recognition

### Best Practice
- Always assess for artifacts first
- Compare findings across montages
- Observe reactivity to patient behavior
- Correlate with clinical findings
- Document artifacts in technical report

### Clinical Impact
- Accurate artifact recognition prevents misdiagnosis
- Good technique reduces artifacts
- Proper documentation helps interpretation
- Artifact recognition is essential skill

## 8. Case-Based Example

### Scenario
**Clinical Setting:** Routine EEG for seizure evaluation  
**EEG Finding:** Rhythmic frontal delta activity  
**Clinical Concern:** Possible frontal lobe dysfunction  
**Pattern:** 2-3 Hz rhythmic slowing, maximum frontal

### Hidden Issue
- **Eye movement artifact** (not cerebral slowing)
- Patient has nystagmus or eye movements
- Eye movement creates rhythmic frontal activity
- Mistaken for frontal slowing

### Correct Action
1. **Observe EOG channels** (if available) - should show eye movement
2. **Check reactivity** - activity changes with eye position
3. **Compare montages** - activity may change with montage
4. **Correlate with clinical** - no clinical findings support frontal dysfunction
5. **Reassess** - recognize as artifact, not pathology

### Teaching Point
- **Always assess artifact before diagnosing pathology**
- Eye movement can mimic frontal slowing
- EOG channels help identify eye movement
- Reactivity and montage comparison help distinguish

### ABRET Application
- Given rhythmic frontal activity → consider eye movement
- Observe EOG channels and reactivity
- Compare across montages
- Correlate with clinical findings
