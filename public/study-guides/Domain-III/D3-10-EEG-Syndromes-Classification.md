- Treatment: Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, lamotrigine. Surgery if medication-resistant.
- Prognosis: Variable - good if medication-responsive, excellent if surgery-responsive

**🔑 Exam Pearl:** Temporal spikes are activated by sleep - sleep recording increases yield.

**🔑 Exam Pearl:** Ictal onset pattern (rhythmic theta/delta evolving to faster frequencies) is critical for localization.

### Frontal Lobe Epilepsy (FLE)

**Age:** All ages  
**EEG Pattern:** Frontal spikes/sharp waves, frontal slowing  
**Morphology:**
- Interictal: Frontal spikes/sharp waves, frontal slowing
- Ictal: Focal onset in frontal region, rapid evolution, may be brief
- Variable amplitude (50-200 µV)
- Focal - frontal (F3, F4, Fz, F7, F8), may be mesial or lateral
- Often brief (seconds to <1 minute)

**Diagnostic Yield Enhancement:**
1. **Sleep** - 70-80% yield
   - Protocol: Natural sleep, especially NREM sleep
   - Notes: Frontal spikes are activated by sleep
2. **Awake** - 50-60% yield
   - Spikes may be present but less frequent
3. **Sleep Deprivation** - 70-80% yield
   - Increases spike frequency
4. **Ictal Recording** - Critical for localization
   - Protocol: Video-EEG with clinical correlation
   - Notes: Seizures may be brief and frequent
5. **Recording Duration** - Minimum 1-2 hours, must include sleep
6. **Montage** - Bipolar (longitudinal and transverse), referential for field analysis. May need additional frontal electrodes.
7. **Video Recording** - Essential - seizures may be brief

**Clinical Features:**
- Brief seizures (seconds to <1 minute)
- Frequent (multiple per day)
- Motor manifestations (tonic, clonic, hypermotor)
- May have vocalizations
- Often occur during sleep
- Rapid recovery, minimal postictal confusion

**Clinical Course:**
- Onset: All ages
- Outcome: Variable - depends on underlying cause
- Treatment: Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, lamotrigine. Surgery if medication-resistant.
- Prognosis: Variable - good if medication-responsive, excellent if surgery-responsive

**🔑 Exam Pearl:** Frontal spikes are activated by sleep - sleep recording increases yield.

**🔑 Exam Pearl:** Frontal seizures are often brief and frequent - longer recordings may be needed.

## 7. ABRET Exam Pearls

### Typical Absence (CAE/JAE)
1. **Hyperventilation** is the most effective activation procedure for CAE (90-95% yield).
2. **Typical absence has NO motor features** - distinguishes from Jeavons (eyelid myoclonus) and JME (myoclonus).
3. **3 Hz spike-and-wave** is generalized, symmetric, and synchronous - distinguishing it from focal discharges.

### Absence with Eyelid Myoclonus (Jeavons)
4. **Photic stimulation** is the most effective activation procedure for Jeavons (90-95% yield) - highly photosensitive.
5. **Eye closure** often triggers eyelid myoclonus and absence (85-90% yield) - repeated eye closure testing is critical.
6. **Eyelid myoclonus** (rhythmic jerking of eyelids) is the most characteristic feature - distinguishes from typical absence.
7. **Jeavons has shorter absence duration** (3-6 seconds) compared to typical absence (5-30 seconds).

### Atypical Absence
8. **Atypical absence has gradual onset/offset** (unlike abrupt typical absence) - key distinguishing feature.
9. **Atypical absence has slower frequency** (1.5-2.5 Hz) compared to typical absence (3 Hz).
10. **Atypical absence occurs in context of LGS** with cognitive impairment - distinguishing it from typical absence.
11. **Sleep recording is CRITICAL** - slow spike-and-wave is most prominent during sleep.

### Neonatal/Infantile Encephalopathies
12. **Ohtahara syndrome** shows burst-suppression pattern that is CONTINUOUS (wake and sleep) - distinguishing it from normal neonatal trace alternant (sleep only).
13. **EME** shows burst-suppression pattern with MYOCLONIC SEIZURES - distinguishing it from Ohtahara (tonic seizures).
14. **Burst-suppression pattern** in Ohtahara/EME is continuous and pathologic - not just during sleep like normal trace alternant.
15. **Dravet syndrome** begins with febrile seizures in first year (peak 6 months) - photosensitive and fever-sensitive.
16. **Onset timing:** Ohtahara/EME (first few days to 3 months) → Dravet (first year) → West Syndrome (3-12 months) → LGS (1-8 years) - epileptic encephalopathy spectrum.

### ESES/CSWS and Landau-Kleffner
17. **ESES pattern** is ONLY seen during NREM sleep (≥85% of slow-wave sleep) - sleep recording is CRITICAL for diagnosis.
18. **ESES pattern** disappears in REM sleep and wakefulness - must record full sleep cycle to see this pattern.
19. **Landau-Kleffner Syndrome** = ESES pattern + ACQUIRED APHASIA (language loss) - this is the defining clinical feature.
20. **Paradoxical in LKS:** Seizures may be infrequent or absent, but EEG shows continuous spike-and-wave during sleep (ESES).

### Other Important Syndromes
16. **Sleep deprivation + awakening** is the most effective activation procedure for JME (90-95% yield).
17. **Sleep recording** is CRITICAL for West Syndrome, LGS, and BRE (95-100% yield).
18. **Centrotemporal spikes** are dramatically activated by sleep (10-100x increase) in BRE.
19. **Slow spike-and-wave (1.5-2.5 Hz)** is characteristic of LGS - slower than typical 3 Hz.
20. **GPFA during sleep** is highly characteristic of LGS.
21. **Multiple seizure types + slow spike-and-wave + cognitive impairment = LGS triad.**
22. **Drop attacks (atonic seizures)** are common in LGS - sudden loss of tone causing falls.
23. **Status epilepticus** may occur in LGS - both non-convulsive (atypical absence status) and convulsive forms.
24. **West Syndrome = Infantile Spasms + Hypsarrhythmia + Developmental Delay/Regression (triad).**
25. **GTCA (Epilepsy with GTC Alone)** = GTC seizures ONLY (no absence, no myoclonus) - often occur upon awakening.
26. **BMEI (Benign Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy)** = Myoclonic seizures ONLY, normal development, excellent prognosis - distinguishes from Dravet (severe, developmental delay).
27. **Doose Syndrome (MAE)** = Myoclonic-astatic seizures (myoclonic jerk followed by atonic drop) - variable prognosis, may remit or evolve to LGS.
28. **Eye Closure Sensitivity Epilepsy** = Seizures triggered by eye closure (85-95% yield with eye closure testing) - may be associated with Jeavons.
29. **Angelman Syndrome** = Genetic condition (15q11-13) with happy demeanor, ataxia, developmental delay, epilepsy - avoid carbamazepine.
30. **Rett Syndrome** = Genetic condition (MECP2) with hand wringing, developmental regression, epilepsy - avoid carbamazepine.
31. **Lissencephaly/Band Heterotopia** = Structural brain malformation (smooth brain or subcortical band) with epilepsy - structural imaging essential for diagnosis.
