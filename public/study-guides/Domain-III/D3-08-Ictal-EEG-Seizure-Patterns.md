## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### Ictal EEG Reflects Active Seizure Activity
- **Ictal EEG reflects active seizure activity:** During seizure
- Ictal = during seizure
- Represents active seizure
- Different from interictal
- Essential distinction

### Defined by Evolution, Not Isolated Sharp Waves
- **Defined by evolution, not isolated sharp waves:** Key characteristic
- Evolution is defining feature
- Not just isolated spikes
- Must show change over time
- Critical distinction

### Not All Seizures Produce Clear Ictal EEG Changes
- **Not all seizures produce clear ictal EEG changes:** Important limitation
- Some seizures have minimal EEG changes
- Deep seizures may not show clearly
- Brief seizures may be missed
- Must understand limitation

### Key Principle
- **Evolution distinguishes ictal activity from interictal discharges**
- Evolution is key feature
- Interictal = no evolution
- Ictal = shows evolution
- Fundamental distinction

### Practical Application
- Look for evolution
- Don't call isolated spikes ictal
- Understand limitations
- Apply correctly

## 2. Ictal vs Interictal EEG

| Feature | Ictal | Interictal |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **Timing** | During seizure | Between seizures |
| **Evolution** | Yes | No |
| **Clinical correlation** | Present | May be absent |

### Key Distinctions

#### Timing
- **Ictal:** During active seizure
- **Interictal:** Between seizures
- Different timing
- Different significance
- Must distinguish

#### Evolution
- **Ictal:** Shows evolution (frequency, amplitude, spread)
- **Interictal:** No evolution (static pattern)
- Evolution is key
- Critical distinction
- Essential feature

#### Clinical Correlation
- **Ictal:** Clinical seizure present
- **Interictal:** No clinical seizure
- Clinical correlation important
- Helps confirm ictal
- Essential context

### Best Practice

## 3. Ictal Onset Patterns

### Common Onset Features

#### Rhythmic Theta or Delta
- **Rhythmic theta or delta:** Common onset

- Often focal
- May be subtle
- Common pattern

#### Focal Attenuation (Electrodecremental Pattern)
- **Focal attenuation (electrodecremental pattern):** Attenuation onset
- Background suppression
- Focal or generalized
- May precede fast activity
- Common pattern

### ABRET Emphasis
- **Ictal onset may be subtle and focal**

## 5. Ictal Termination & Postictal Changes

### Abrupt Cessation or Gradual Slowing

### Postictal Suppression or Slowing Common
- **Postictal suppression or slowing common:** Postictal changes
- Suppression after seizure
- Slowing after seizure
- Common findings
- Helps confirm ictal

### Helps Confirm True Ictal Event
- **Helps confirm true ictal event:** Confirmation value
- Postictal changes confirm seizure
- Supports ictal diagnosis
- Important confirmation
- Essential feature

### Best Practice
- Recognize termination patterns
- Understand postictal changes
- Use for confirmation
- Apply correctly

## 6. Ictal EEG vs Artifact

| Feature | Ictal EEG | Artifact |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Evolution** | Present | Absent |
| **Field** | Physiologic | Non-physiologic |
| **Correlation** | Clinical seizure | Movement/noise |

### Key Distinctions

#### Evolution
- **Ictal EEG:** Shows evolution
- **Artifact:** No evolution
- Evolution is key
- Critical distinction
- Essential feature

#### Field
- **Ictal EEG:** Physiologic field
- **Artifact:** Non-physiologic field
- Field characteristics differ
- Important distinction
- Helps differentiate

#### Correlation
- **Ictal EEG:** Clinical seizure present
- **Artifact:** Movement or noise
- Clinical correlation important
- Helps differentiate
- Essential context

### ABRET Trap
- **Rhythmic movement artifact lacks EEG evolution**
- Movement may be rhythmic
- But lacks EEG evolution
- Must distinguish
- Critical distinction

### Best Practice
- Look for evolution
- Check field characteristics
- Correlate clinically
- Distinguish correctly

## 7. Common ABRET Exam Traps

### Trap 1: Calling Isolated Spikes Ictal
- **Reality:** Ictal requires evolution
- **Trap:** May call isolated spikes ictal
- **Solution:** Ictal requires evolution, not just spikes
- **ABRET focus:** Evolution requirement

### Trap 2: Confusing Muscle Artifact with Ictal Fast Activity
- **Reality:** Muscle artifact lacks evolution
- **Trap:** May call muscle artifact ictal
- **Solution:** Look for evolution, check field
- **ABRET focus:** Artifact vs ictal distinction

### Trap 3: Ignoring Lack of Evolution
- **Reality:** Evolution is required for ictal
- **Trap:** May call non-evolving pattern ictal
- **Solution:** Require evolution for ictal
- **ABRET focus:** Evolution requirement

### Trap 4: Overinterpreting Brief Rhythmic Patterns
- **Reality:** Brief patterns may not be ictal
- **Trap:** May call brief rhythmic pattern ictal
- **Solution:** Require sufficient duration and evolution
- **ABRET focus:** Duration and evolution requirements

### Trap 5: Not Recognizing Postictal Changes
- **Reality:** Postictal changes confirm ictal
- **Trap:** May miss postictal changes
- **Solution:** Look for postictal suppression or slowing
- **ABRET focus:** Postictal recognition

### Absence of Ictal EEG Does Not Exclude Seizures
- **Absence of ictal EEG does not exclude seizures:** Important limitation
- Some seizures don't show on EEG
- Deep seizures may not show
- Brief seizures may be missed
- Must understand limitation

### Best Practice
- Use ictal EEG for classification and localization

## 9. Case-Based Example

### Scenario
**Clinical Setting:** Video-EEG monitoring  
**EEG Finding:** Rhythmic left temporal theta increasing in amplitude and spreading  
**Question:** What does this represent?

### Interpretation
- **Left temporal ictal onset**
- Rhythmic theta = ictal pattern
- Left temporal = focal onset
- Evolution (amplitude increase, spread) = confirms ictal
- Ictal diagnosis

### Teaching Point
- **Temporal evolution supports ictal diagnosis**
- Evolution is key feature
- Frequency, amplitude, spread changes
- Confirms ictal diagnosis
- Essential for interpretation

### ABRET Application
- Given evolving pattern → recognize ictal
- Given focal onset → localize seizure
- Given interpretation → require evolution
- Must know ictal characteristics
