## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### Background Rhythm Reflects Global Cortical Function
- **Background rhythm reflects global cortical function**
- Normal background indicates normal cortical function
- Abnormal background indicates cortical dysfunction
- Background is the foundation of EEG interpretation

### Diffuse Slowing Indicates Generalized Cerebral Dysfunction
- **Diffuse slowing indicates generalized cerebral dysfunction**
- Bilateral, widespread slowing
- Suggests global brain dysfunction
- Different from focal slowing (localized)

### Severity Correlates with Degree of Slowing
- **Severity correlates with degree of slowing**
- Mild: Slowed PDR, excess theta
- Moderate: Dominant theta/delta
- Severe: High-amplitude delta, loss of organization
- Severity guides clinical correlation

### Key Principle
- **Background organization is more important than amplitude alone**
- Organization (rhythmicity, reactivity) matters more than amplitude
- Well-organized slow background is less severe than disorganized
- Must assess both frequency and organization

### Practical Application
- Always assess background first
- Classify as normal, mild, moderate, or severe slowing
- Exclude technical causes before interpretation
- Correlate with clinical presentation

## 2. Normal Background Review

### Adults

#### Posterior Dominant Rhythm (PDR)
- **8–13 Hz** (alpha range)
- Present in wakefulness with eyes closed
- Reactive to eye opening (attenuates)
- Symmetric, well-organized
- Maximal over occipital regions

#### Normal Variants
- **Beta:** 14–30 Hz, frontal-central, low amplitude
- **Theta:** 4–7 Hz, frontal, drowsiness
- **Delta:** <4 Hz, sleep stages, minimal in wake

### Children

#### Age-Dependent Norms
- **Newborns:** Discontinuous, mixed frequencies
- **3 months:** Continuous, 3–4 Hz dominant
- **6 months:** 4–5 Hz dominant
- **1 year:** 5–6 Hz dominant
- **3 years:** 7–8 Hz dominant
- **8 years:** 8–9 Hz dominant
- **Adolescence:** Adult-like (8–13 Hz)

#### Key Points
- Background frequency increases with age
- Organization improves with maturation
- Must use age-appropriate norms
- Don't overcall slowing in children

### Background Must Be Assessed In

#### Wakefulness
- **Eyes closed:** PDR should be present
- **Eyes open:** PDR should attenuate (reactivity)
- **Mental tasks:** PDR may attenuate
- **Alertness:** Background should be organized

#### Drowsiness
- **PDR slows:** May drop to 7–8 Hz
- **Frontal theta:** Normal drowsy pattern
- **Vertex waves:** Normal drowsy pattern
- **Reactivity:** May be reduced

#### Sleep (If Present)
- **Stage 1:** Theta, vertex waves
- **Stage 2:** Sleep spindles, K-complexes
- **Stage 3/4:** Delta activity (normal)
- **REM:** Low amplitude, mixed frequencies

## 3. Diffuse Slowing Patterns

### Mild Diffuse Slowing

#### Characteristics
- **Slowed PDR:** PDR <8 Hz in adults
- **Excess theta:** More theta than expected for age/state
- **Preserved organization:** Background still organized
- **Reactivity present:** May still react to eye opening

#### Clinical Significance
- **Mild encephalopathy:** Early metabolic/toxic changes
- **Medication effects:** Some medications cause mild slowing
- **Fatigue:** May be seen with sleep deprivation
- **Often reversible:** May improve with treatment

### Moderate Diffuse Slowing

#### Characteristics
- **Dominant theta/delta:** Theta or delta is dominant frequency
- **Reduced organization:** Background less organized
- **Reduced reactivity:** May not react to eye opening
- **PDR absent or very slow:** <7 Hz or absent

#### Clinical Significance
- **Moderate encephalopathy:** More significant dysfunction
- **Metabolic disorders:** Hepatic, renal, metabolic causes
- **Toxic states:** Medications, toxins, drugs
- **May be reversible:** Depends on cause

### Severe Diffuse Slowing

#### Characteristics
- **High-amplitude delta:** Dominant delta activity
- **Loss of organization:** Disorganized, chaotic background
- **No reactivity:** No response to stimulation
- **PDR absent:** No organized background rhythm

#### Clinical Significance
- **Severe encephalopathy:** Profound dysfunction
- **Hypoxic injury:** Post-anoxic encephalopathy
- **Severe metabolic:** End-stage metabolic disorders
- **Poor prognosis:** Often indicates severe injury

### ABRET Emphasis
- **Severity of slowing reflects encephalopathy depth**
- Mild slowing = mild dysfunction
- Moderate slowing = moderate dysfunction
- Severe slowing = severe dysfunction
- Must grade severity accurately

## 4. Diffuse vs Focal Slowing

| Feature | Diffuse | Focal |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Distribution** | Bilateral | Regional |
| **Symmetry** | Usually symmetric | Asymmetric |
| **Etiology** | Metabolic/toxic | Structural |
| **Localization** | No | Yes |
| **Clinical Implication** | Systemic cause | Focal lesion |
| **Imaging** | May not need | Often warranted |
| **Treatment** | Systemic | Focal (may be surgical) |

### Key Distinctions

#### Diffuse Slowing
- **Bilateral distribution:** Both hemispheres involved
- **Usually symmetric:** Both sides equally affected
- **Systemic causes:** Metabolic, toxic, infectious
- **No localization:** Cannot localize to specific region

#### Focal Slowing
- **Regional distribution:** Limited to one area
- **Asymmetric:** One side more affected
- **Structural causes:** Lesion, scar, stroke
- **Localization possible:** Can identify specific region

### Clinical Application
- Distribution guides etiology
- Diffuse = systemic evaluation (labs, metabolic)
- Focal = structural evaluation (imaging)
- Must distinguish before interpretation

## 5. Technical Pitfalls

### High LFF Masking Delta
- **Problem:** High LFF (e.g., 5 Hz) attenuates delta activity
- **Result:** May mask true diffuse slowing
- **Solution:** Use low LFF (0.5–1 Hz) to see slow activity
- **ABRET trap:** Calling normal background when LFF too high

### Low HFF Exaggerating Slowing
- **Problem:** Low HFF (e.g., 15 Hz) may exaggerate slow activity
- **Result:** May make normal background appear slow
- **Solution:** Use appropriate HFF (35–70 Hz) for routine
- **ABRET trap:** Overcalling slowing with low HFF

### Inappropriate Sensitivity
- **Problem:** Too high or too low sensitivity affects appearance
- **Result:** May make background appear abnormal
- **Solution:** Use standard sensitivity (7.5–10 µV/mm)
- **ABRET trap:** Misinterpreting amplitude changes as slowing

### Aliasing Mimicking Slowing
- **Problem:** Inadequate sampling rate causes aliasing
- **Result:** High-frequency activity appears as slow activity
- **Solution:** Use adequate sampling rate (≥200 Hz)
- **ABRET trap:** Calling slowing when it's actually aliasing

### ABRET Trap
- **Always verify settings before calling diffuse slowing**
- Check LFF, HFF, sensitivity, sampling rate
- Technical errors can mimic or mask slowing
- Must exclude technical causes first

### Best Practice
- Verify all technical settings
- Compare across montages
- Check for artifacts
- Confirm with clinical correlation

## 7. Common ABRET Exam Traps

### Trap 1: Calling Diffuse Slowing with Raised LFF
- **Reality:** High LFF masks slow activity
- **Trap:** May call normal background when LFF too high
- **Solution:** Always check LFF before interpreting
- **ABRET focus:** Technical settings affect interpretation

### Trap 2: Overlocalizing Symmetric Slowing
- **Reality:** Symmetric slowing is diffuse, not focal
- **Trap:** May try to localize symmetric patterns
- **Solution:** Symmetric = diffuse, not focal
- **ABRET focus:** Distribution classification

### Trap 3: Ignoring Age-Related Norms
- **Reality:** Background frequency varies with age
- **Trap:** May overcall slowing in children
- **Solution:** Use age-appropriate norms
- **ABRET focus:** Pediatric vs adult norms

### Trap 4: Confusing Sleep-Related Slowing with Pathology
- **Reality:** Delta in sleep is normal
- **Trap:** May call normal sleep delta as slowing
- **Solution:** Must know patient state (wake vs sleep)
- **ABRET focus:** State-dependent interpretation

### Trap 5: Not Excluding Technical Causes
- **Reality:** Technical errors can mimic slowing
- **Trap:** May call technical artifact as slowing
- **Solution:** Always verify settings first
- **ABRET focus:** Technical troubleshooting

## 8. Case-Based Example

### Scenario
**Clinical Setting:** ICU EEG for altered mental status  
**EEG Finding:** Generalized theta with poorly formed PDR  
**Clinical History:** Hepatic encephalopathy  
**Pattern:** Diffuse theta (4–7 Hz), bilateral, symmetric, poorly organized

### Interpretation
- **Mild to moderate diffuse slowing**
- Bilateral, symmetric theta
- Poorly organized background
- Consistent with metabolic encephalopathy

### Teaching Point
- **Diffuse slowing reflects global dysfunction, not focal lesions**
- Bilateral, symmetric = diffuse, not focal
- Metabolic causes common (hepatic, renal, toxic)
- Must correlate with clinical presentation

### ABRET Application
- Given diffuse slowing → classify severity (mild/moderate/severe)
- Understand that diffuse = systemic, not structural
- Know that technical settings must be verified
- Correlate with clinical findings
