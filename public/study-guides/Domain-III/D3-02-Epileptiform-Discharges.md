## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### Definition
- **Epileptiform discharges reflect cortical hyperexcitability**
- Abnormal EEG waveforms associated with increased seizure risk
- Interictal (between seizures), not seizures themselves
- Presence suggests but does not prove epilepsy

### Clinical Significance
- **Presence increases seizure risk** but is not diagnostic alone
- Must correlate with clinical history and findings
- Absence does not exclude epilepsy
- EEG supports diagnosis, does not diagnose alone

### Key Principle
- **EEG supports the diagnosis of epilepsy; it does not diagnose epilepsy alone**
- Clinical history is essential
- EEG findings must correlate with symptoms
- Never diagnose epilepsy based on EEG alone

### Practical Application
- Identify epileptiform morphology accurately
- Differentiate from artifacts and normal variants
- Correlate with clinical presentation
- Understand limitations of EEG in epilepsy diagnosis

## 2. Epileptiform Morphology

### Spikes

#### Characteristics
- **Duration: < 70 ms** (very brief)
- **Sharp contour** (distinct from background)
- **High spatial gradient** (sharp rise and fall)
- Pointed, spiky appearance
- Distinct from background activity

#### Recognition
- Very brief duration (< 70 ms)
- Sharp, pointed morphology
- Stands out from background
- May be followed by slow wave
- Focal or generalized distribution

#### Clinical Correlation
- Suggests cortical irritability
- Associated with increased seizure risk
- May localize to specific brain region
- More significant if frequent or in runs

### Sharp Waves

#### Characteristics
- **Duration: 70–200 ms** (longer than spikes)
- **Similar morphology to spikes** (sharp contour)
- **Longer duration** distinguishes from spikes
- Blunt or rounded peak possible
- Distinct from background

#### Recognition
- Longer duration than spikes (70-200 ms)
- Sharp contour, similar to spikes
- Stands out from background
- May be followed by slow wave
- Focal or generalized distribution

#### Clinical Correlation
- Similar significance to spikes
- Suggests cortical irritability
- Associated with increased seizure risk
- May localize to specific brain region

### Spike-and-Wave Complexes

#### Characteristics
- **Spike followed by slow wave** (characteristic complex)
- **Often generalized** but may be focal
- Repetitive pattern
- Stereotyped morphology
- Distinct from background

#### Recognition
- Spike component (< 70 ms)
- Followed by slow wave (200-500 ms typical)
- Repetitive, stereotyped pattern
- May occur in bursts or continuously
- Generalized or focal distribution

#### Clinical Correlation
- **Generalized:** Suggests generalized epilepsy syndromes
- **Focal:** Suggests focal epilepsy
- Frequency may correlate with seizure type
- 3 Hz spike-and-wave: typical absence epilepsy
- Slower frequencies: other syndromes

### Polyspikes

#### Characteristics
- **Multiple spikes in rapid succession**
- No slow wave component (or minimal)
- Fast, repetitive spikes
- May be generalized or focal
- High-frequency appearance

#### Recognition
- Multiple spikes in sequence
- Fast repetition
- No or minimal slow wave
- May be brief or prolonged
- Generalized or focal

#### Clinical Correlation

## 3. Distribution & Localization

### Focal Discharges

#### Characteristics
- **Localized to specific brain region**
- May show phase reversal in bipolar montages
- Consistent localization across montages
- Suggests focal cortical irritability

#### Clinical Significance
- **Suggest focal epilepsy** (temporal, frontal, etc.)
- **Often structural correlation** (lesion, scar, etc.)
- May guide imaging studies
- Important for surgical planning

#### Common Locations
- **Temporal:** Most common (temporal lobe epilepsy)
- **Frontal:** Second most common
- **Parietal/Occipital:** Less common
- **Rolandic:** Benign rolandic epilepsy (children)

### Generalized Discharges

#### Characteristics
- **Bilateral, synchronous** (both hemispheres)
- **Symmetric or asymmetric** (asymmetry may indicate focal onset)
- Suggests generalized epilepsy syndromes
- May be frontally predominant

#### Clinical Significance
- **Suggest generalized epilepsy syndromes**
- Idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE)
- Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE)
- Juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE)
- Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME)

### ABRET Emphasis
- **Localization depends on persistence across montages**
- Must see consistent localization in multiple montages
- Phase reversal helps localize focal discharges
- Generalized discharges are bilateral and synchronous

### Asymmetric Generalized
- **Bilateral but asymmetric** (one side more prominent)
- May indicate focal onset with secondary generalization
- Asymmetry suggests focal component
- Important for syndrome classification

## 4. Epileptiform vs Normal Variants

| Feature | Epileptiform | Normal Variant |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Sharp contour** | Yes | May appear sharp |
| **Field** | Physiologic (appropriate distribution) | Limited (specific location) |
| **Reactivity** | Persistent (across states) | State-dependent (sleep/wake) |
| **Clinical relevance** | Increased seizure risk | Benign (no increased risk) |
| **Morphology** | Stereotyped | Variable |
| **Distribution** | May be widespread | Localized |
| **Following slow wave** | Common | Rare or absent |

### Key Distinctions

#### Epileptiform Discharges
- **Physiologic field** (appropriate for brain region)
- **Persistent across states** (wake and sleep)
- **Stereotyped morphology** (consistent appearance)
- **Increased seizure risk** (clinical significance)
- **May have following slow wave** (spike-and-wave)

#### Normal Variants
- **Limited field** (specific location, e.g., central, temporal)
- **State-dependent** (may only appear in sleep)
- **Variable morphology** (less stereotyped)
- **Benign** (no increased seizure risk)
- **No following slow wave** (or minimal)

### Common Normal Variants to Distinguish
- **Rolandic spikes** (benign, central-temporal, children)
- **Wicket spikes** (benign, temporal, adults)
- **14 and 6 Hz positive spikes** (benign, posterior, sleep)
- **Small sharp spikes (SSS)** (benign, temporal, sleep)

### ABRET Application
- Given sharp waveform → distinguish epileptiform vs variant
- Use field, reactivity, and morphology to distinguish
- Understand clinical significance of each
- Know which variants are benign

## 5. Activation Effects

### Sleep

#### Effect
- **Enhances epileptiform activity** (increases diagnostic yield)
- Many epileptiform discharges appear or increase in sleep
- Sleep deprivation increases yield further
- NREM sleep (especially stage 2) most activating

#### Clinical Application
- Sleep-deprived EEG increases diagnostic yield
- Sleep recording essential for epilepsy evaluation
- Many focal epilepsies show discharges only in sleep
- Document sleep state when discharges appear

#### ABRET Emphasis
- Sleep increases diagnostic yield
- Many discharges appear only in sleep
- Sleep-deprived EEG is standard for epilepsy evaluation
- Document sleep state for discharges

### Hyperventilation

#### Effect
- **Activates generalized discharges** (especially 3 Hz spike-and-wave)
- Provokes absence seizures in susceptible patients
- Increases diagnostic yield for generalized epilepsies
- Less effective for focal epilepsies

#### Clinical Application
- Standard activation for absence epilepsy
- Provokes typical absence seizures
- Increases yield for generalized epilepsies
- Document response to hyperventilation

#### ABRET Emphasis
- Hyperventilation activates generalized discharges
- Essential for absence epilepsy evaluation
- Provokes clinical and EEG changes
- Document response

### Photic Stimulation

#### Effect
- **May provoke photic-induced discharges** (photoparoxysmal response)
- Can activate generalized epileptiform activity
- Provokes seizures in photosensitive patients
- Less common than sleep or hyperventilation activation

#### Clinical Application
- Standard activation for photosensitive epilepsy
- Provokes photoparoxysmal response
- May activate generalized discharges
- Document photic response

#### ABRET Emphasis
- Photic stimulation can activate discharges
- Photoparoxysmal response is significant finding
- Provokes seizures in photosensitive patients
- Document response

## 6. Common ABRET Exam Traps

### Trap 1: Mistaking Artifact for Spikes
- **Reality:** Artifacts can mimic spikes (electrode pop, muscle)
- Artifacts change with montage, true spikes persist
- Artifacts don't correlate with clinical findings
- Must compare across montages to distinguish

### Trap 2: Overcalling Benign Variants
- **Reality:** Normal variants can appear sharp
- Benign variants are state-dependent, epileptiform persists
- Benign variants have limited field, epileptiform has physiologic field
- Must know which variants are benign

### Trap 3: Assuming All Spikes Equal Epilepsy
- **Reality:** Spikes increase risk but don't diagnose epilepsy
- Clinical history is essential
- EEG supports diagnosis, doesn't diagnose alone
- Absence of spikes doesn't exclude epilepsy

### Trap 4: Ignoring State of Occurrence
- **Reality:** State matters for interpretation
- Sleep-activated discharges are significant
- Wake-only discharges may be less significant
- Must document state when discharges appear

### Trap 5: Not Correlating with Clinical Findings
- **Reality:** EEG must correlate with clinical presentation
- Discharges without clinical correlation are less significant
- Clinical history guides interpretation
- Always integrate EEG with clinical findings

## 7. Clinical Correlation

### Epileptiform Discharges

#### Increase Seizure Recurrence Risk
- Presence of discharges increases risk of future seizures
- More frequent discharges may indicate higher risk
- Localization may predict seizure type
- Important for treatment decisions

#### Guide Syndrome Classification
- **Focal discharges:** Suggest focal epilepsy
- **Generalized discharges:** Suggest generalized epilepsy
- **Specific patterns:** Guide syndrome diagnosis (e.g., 3 Hz = absence)
- Important for treatment selection

#### Absence Does Not Exclude Epilepsy
- Normal EEG does not exclude epilepsy
- Many patients with epilepsy have normal interictal EEG
- Clinical history is more important than EEG
- Repeat EEG or prolonged monitoring may be needed

### Clinical Application
- Use EEG to support clinical diagnosis
- Correlate findings with seizure semiology
- Guide treatment decisions
- Understand limitations of interictal EEG

### Best Practice
- Always correlate EEG with clinical findings
- Never diagnose epilepsy based on EEG alone
- Understand that normal EEG doesn't exclude epilepsy
- Use EEG to support, not replace, clinical judgment

## 8. Case-Based Example

### Scenario
**Clinical Setting:** Routine EEG for seizure evaluation  
**EEG Finding:** Left temporal sharp waves during sleep  
**Clinical History:** Focal impaired awareness seizures  
**Pattern:** Sharp waves at T7, T3, maximum during sleep

### Interpretation
- **Suggests focal epileptiform activity** (left temporal)
- Sharp waves are epileptiform (not artifact or variant)
- Sleep activation increases significance
- Localization matches clinical presentation (temporal seizures)

### Clinical Correlation
- **Increased likelihood of focal epilepsy** (temporal lobe epilepsy)
- EEG supports clinical diagnosis
- Localization guides treatment and imaging
- Sleep activation confirms significance

### Teaching Point
- **Sleep increases diagnostic yield of EEG**
- Many epileptiform discharges appear only in sleep
- Sleep-deprived EEG is standard for epilepsy evaluation
- Document sleep state when discharges appear

### ABRET Application
- Given sharp waves in sleep → recognize as epileptiform
- Understand sleep activation significance
- Correlate with clinical presentation
- Know that sleep increases diagnostic yield
