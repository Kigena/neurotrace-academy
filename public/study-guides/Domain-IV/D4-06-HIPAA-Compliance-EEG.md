## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### HIPAA Protects Patient Privacy

- **HIPAA = Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (1996)**
- **Primary Purpose:** Protect patient health information (PHI)
- **Applies to:** All healthcare providers, facilities, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses
- **Two Main Rules:**
  1. **Privacy Rule** (2003): Protects PHI and gives patients rights
  2. **Security Rule** (2005): Requires safeguards for electronic PHI (ePHI)
- **Violations have serious consequences:** Fines, legal action, job loss, professional discipline

### Protected Health Information (PHI)

**PHI includes ANY information that:**
- Identifies or could identify a patient
- Relates to past, present, or future physical/mental health
- Relates to healthcare services provided
- Relates to payment for healthcare
- Is created, received, maintained, or transmitted by a covered entity

**Key Point:** PHI is not just medical records - it includes ANY information that could identify a patient in a healthcare context.

### Key Principle

**Patient information is confidential and must be protected at all times**
- Confidentiality is a legal requirement (HIPAA)
- Confidentiality is an ethical requirement (professional standards)
- Violations can result in:
  - Civil penalties: $100 - $50,000 per violation (up to $1.5 million per year)
  - Criminal penalties: Up to $250,000 fine and 10 years imprisonment
  - Job termination
  - Loss of professional license
  - Lawsuits from patients

### Practical Application

- Always protect patient information in all settings
- Share only with authorized personnel on a need-to-know basis
- Use secure methods for storage and transmission
- Follow facility policies and HIPAA regulations strictly
- When in doubt, choose the more protective option

## 2. The 18 HIPAA Identifiers (Complete List)

### All 18 Identifiers Must Be Removed for De-identification

1. **Names** (patient, family members, employers, household members)
   - First name, last name, middle initial
   - Maiden name, alias, nickname
   - Any name that could identify the patient

2. **Geographic subdivisions smaller than state**
   - Street address
   - City
   - County
   - Precinct
   - Zip code (first 3 digits if population < 20,000)
   - Any geographic identifier smaller than state

3. **All elements of dates (except year)**
   - Date of birth
   - Date of admission
   - Date of discharge
   - Date of death
   - Date of service
   - Ages over 89 (must be aggregated to "90 or older")
   - Any date that could identify the patient

4. **Telephone numbers**
   - Home, work, mobile
   - Any phone number

5. **Fax numbers**
   - Any fax number

6. **Email addresses**
   - Personal or work email
   - Any email address

7. **Social Security numbers**
   - Full SSN
   - Last 4 digits (if unique enough to identify)

8. **Medical record numbers**
   - Hospital MRN
   - Clinic patient ID
   - Any unique medical identifier

9. **Health plan beneficiary numbers**
   - Insurance member ID
   - Policy numbers
   - Any health plan identifier

10. **Account numbers**
    - Bank account
    - Credit card
    - Any financial account number

11. **Certificate/license numbers**
    - Driver's license
    - Professional license
    - Any certificate or license number

12. **Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers**
    - License plate numbers
    - VIN numbers
    - Any vehicle identifier

13. **Device identifiers and serial numbers**
    - Medical device serial numbers
    - Equipment identifiers
    - Any device serial number

14. **Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs)**
    - Personal websites
    - Social media URLs
    - Any web address

15. **Internet Protocol (IP) addresses**
    - Computer IP addresses
    - Network identifiers
    - Any IP address

16. **Biometric identifiers**
    - Fingerprints
    - Voiceprints
    - Retinal scans
    - DNA
    - Any unique biometric identifier

17. **Full face photographic images**

18. **Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code**
    - Any other identifier not listed above
    - Unique combinations of data
    - Any code that could identify the patient

### Key Rules for De-identification

- **All 18 identifiers must be removed** - removing just the name is NOT sufficient
- **Must prevent re-identification** - even if all identifiers are removed, if the data can still identify the patient, it's not de-identified
- **Rare findings can be identifiers** - unique clinical findings, rare patterns, or unique combinations can allow re-identification
- **When in doubt, don't use it** - if you're unsure if data is de-identified, don't use it

### Examples of Re-identification Risks

- **Rare EEG pattern:** "Only 2 patients in facility history had this pattern" = identifiable
- **Specific timing:** "EEG performed on 3/15/2023 at 2:30 PM" = identifiable (even without name)
- **Unique combinations:** "45-year-old male with rare syndrome X and pattern Y" = identifiable
- **Geographic + timing:** "Patient from City Z with rare finding on Date X" = identifiable

---

## 3. Minimum Necessary Rule

### Core Principle

**Share only the minimum patient information necessary to perform the specific task**

- Not everyone needs all information
- Only share on a "need-to-know" basis
- Limit access to what is required for the specific purpose
- Do not share more than necessary

### Examples by Role

**Ordering Physician:**
- Needs: Clinical indication, EEG findings, interpretation
- Does NOT need: Billing codes, insurance details, payment information

**Billing Department:**
- Needs: Procedure codes, dates of service, patient demographics (for billing)
- Does NOT need: Detailed clinical findings, EEG interpretations, medical history

**Quality Assurance:**
- Needs: De-identified data only (no PHI)
- Does NOT need: Patient names, MRNs, or any identifiers

**Teaching/Education:**
- Needs: Fully de-identified data only
- Does NOT need: Any patient identifiers or unique details

**Other Technologists:**
- Needs: Only if directly involved in patient care
- Does NOT need: Information about patients they're not caring for

### Practical Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Billing Request**
- **Request:** Billing department asks for patient information
- **Appropriate:** Share procedure codes, dates, basic demographics
- **Inappropriate:** Share detailed clinical findings, EEG interpretations, medical history

**Scenario 2: Teaching Conference**
- **Request:** Use EEG tracing for teaching
- **Appropriate:** Fully de-identified tracing (all 18 identifiers removed)
- **Inappropriate:** Tracing with MRN, date, or any identifier

**Scenario 3: Physician Consultation**
- **Request:** Ordering physician asks about findings
- **Appropriate:** Share relevant clinical findings and observations
- **Inappropriate:** Share information about other patients or unrelated details

### Key Principle

**Minimum necessary = only what is needed for the specific task**
- Ask yourself: "Does this person need this information to do their job?"
- When in doubt, share less, not more
- Follow facility policies for information sharing

## 5. De-identification for Teaching Materials

### Complete De-identification Required

**Teaching materials must be completely de-identified:**

1. **Remove all 18 HIPAA identifiers** (see Section 2)
2. **Remove unique clinical details** that could identify patient
3. **Remove rare findings** that could allow re-identification
4. **Ensure re-identification is not possible**

### Examples of Re-identification Risks

**Rare Patterns or Findings:**
- "Only 2 patients in facility history had this pattern" = identifiable
- "Unique combination of findings" = identifiable
- "Rare syndrome presentation" = identifiable

**Specific Dates or Timing:**
- "EEG performed on 3/15/2023 at 2:30 PM" = identifiable
- "Patient admitted on specific holiday" = identifiable
- "Unique timing of events" = identifiable

**Unique Combinations:**
- "45-year-old male with rare syndrome X and pattern Y" = identifiable
- Multiple details together can identify patient
- Combination of age, gender, and rare finding = identifiable

**Geographic Details:**
- "Patient from City Z with rare finding on Date X" = identifiable
- Location + timing + findings = identification
- Even without name, can be identified

### De-identification Checklist

**Before using material for teaching, verify:**

- [ ] All 18 HIPAA identifiers removed
- [ ] Dates removed or generalized (year only, if necessary)
- [ ] Rare findings removed or generalized
- [ ] Unique combinations removed
- [ ] Geographic details removed
