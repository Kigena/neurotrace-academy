## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### Patient Safety Is First Priority
- **Patient safety is the first priority in all situations**
- Safety overrides diagnostic yield
- Stop procedures if safety is compromised
- Maintain patient safety during emergencies
- Continue recording only if it can be done safely

### Technologists Must Be Prepared for Emergencies
- **Technologists must be prepared for emergencies:**
- Know emergency response protocols
- Maintain BLS certification (if required)
- Know facility emergency procedures
- Know when to activate emergency response

### Key Principle
- **Patient safety first, then diagnostic yield**
- Safety is always the priority
- When in doubt, prioritize patient safety
- Activate emergency response when needed

### Practical Application
- Always prioritize patient safety
- Know emergency response protocols
- Maintain current BLS certification
- Activate emergency response promptly when needed

---

## 2. Seizure Response Protocol

### During a Seizure
- **First priority: Ensure patient safety**
- Protect patient's head from injury (pillow, padding)
- Do NOT place anything in patient's mouth
- Do NOT restrain the patient
- Time the seizure duration
- Maintain airway if possible (positioning)
- Continue recording if it can be done safely

### Critical Rule: Never Place Objects in Mouth
- **NEVER place objects in a patient's mouth during a seizure:**
- Can cause broken teeth
- Can cause airway obstruction
- Can cause injury to patient or rescuer
- Can cause choking
- This is a critical safety rule

### After a Seizure
- **After a seizure:**
- Position patient on side (recovery position)
- Check breathing and pulse
- Monitor patient condition
- Document seizure duration and characteristics
- Notify physician if required per protocol
- Continue monitoring

---

## 3. Status Epilepticus Recognition

### What Is Status Epilepticus?
- **Status epilepticus:**
- Seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes (generalized tonic-clonic)
- OR multiple seizures without return to baseline
- OR continuous seizure activity
- Medical emergency requiring immediate intervention

### Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus
- **Nonconvulsive status epilepticus:**
- Continuous seizure activity on EEG
- Patient may appear unresponsive or confused
- May not have obvious convulsions
- Requires EEG for recognition
- Medical emergency

### Response to Status Epilepticus
- **If status epilepticus is suspected:**
- Ensure patient safety immediately
- Activate emergency response per protocol
- Notify physician immediately
- Continue recording if it can be done safely
- Do not wait - this is a medical emergency

## 4. Basic Life Support (BLS) Principles

### ABCs of BLS
- **A - Airway:** Ensure airway is open and clear
- **B - Breathing:** Check breathing, provide rescue breaths if needed
- **C - Circulation:** Check pulse, provide chest compressions if needed

### Technologist Role in BLS
- **Technologist role:**
- Maintain current BLS certification (if required by facility)
- Know when to activate emergency response
- Assist with BLS if trained and authorized
- Continue recording if it can be done safely
- Follow facility protocols

### Key Principle
- **Know your role and limitations**
- Activate emergency response promptly
- Assist within scope of practice and training
- Do not exceed your training or authorization

## 5. Emergency Response Activation

### When to Activate Emergency Response
- **Activate emergency response for:**
- Status epilepticus
- Cardiac arrest
- Respiratory distress
- Severe allergic reaction
- Loss of consciousness (unexplained)
- Any life-threatening emergency

### How to Activate
- **Follow facility protocol:**
- Call emergency code (e.g., Code Blue)
- Use emergency call button if available
- Notify physician immediately
- Follow facility-specific procedures

### Key Principle
- **When in doubt, activate emergency response**
- Do not delay for uncertain situations
- Better to activate and cancel than delay
- Patient safety requires prompt action

---

## 6. Maintaining Recording During Emergencies

### Continue Recording If Safe
- **Continue recording during emergencies if:**
- Patient safety is not compromised
- Recording does not interfere with emergency care
- Equipment remains functional
- Data is valuable for treatment decisions

### Stop Recording If Necessary
- **Stop recording if:**
- Recording interferes with patient care
- Equipment must be disconnected for safety
- Patient safety is compromised by continuing
- Emergency personnel require equipment removal

### Key Principle
- **Patient safety first, then recording**
- Continue recording only if it can be done safely
- Stop recording if it interferes with patient care
- The data is valuable but safety is paramount

---

## 7. Documentation of Emergencies

### What to Document
- **Document all emergency events:**
- Time of event onset
- Duration of event
- Patient condition before, during, and after
- Actions taken
- Emergency response activation
- Physician notification
- Outcome

### Key Principle
- **Document everything that happened**
- Complete documentation is essential
- Document times, actions, and outcomes
- Follow facility documentation requirements

---

## 8. Common Emergency Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizure
- **Response:**
- Protect head, do NOT place objects in mouth
- Time duration, maintain airway
- Continue recording if safe
- Position on side after seizure
- Notify physician per protocol

### Scenario 2: Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus
- **Response:**
- Recognize pattern on EEG
- Ensure patient safety
- Activate emergency response immediately
- Notify physician immediately
- Continue recording if safe

### Scenario 3: Cardiac Arrest
- **Response:**
- Activate emergency response immediately
- Begin BLS if trained and authorized
- Continue recording if it does not interfere
- Follow facility protocols

### Scenario 4: Respiratory Distress
- **Response:**
- Ensure airway is clear
- Activate emergency response
- Notify physician
- Continue recording if safe
- Monitor patient condition
