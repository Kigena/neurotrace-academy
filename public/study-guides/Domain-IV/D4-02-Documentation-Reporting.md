**Domain:** Domain IV – Professional Practice, Documentation & Ethics  
**Section:** EEG Documentation & Reporting Standards  
**Style:** Structured, policy-based, exam-oriented

---

## 1. Core Principles (Must Know)

### EEG Reports Are Legal Medical Documents
- **EEG reports are legal medical documents**
- Reports are part of the medical record
- Subject to legal review
- Must be accurate and complete

### Documentation Must Be

#### Accurate
- **Accurate:** Report findings correctly
- No exaggeration or minimization
- Factual and truthful
- Based on actual observations

#### Objective
- **Objective:** Neutral, unbiased language
- Avoid subjective interpretations
- Use standardized terminology
- Describe, don't interpret

#### Complete
- **Complete:** Include all required elements
- Document all relevant findings
- Note technical parameters
- Record events and responses

### Technologists Document Observations, Not Diagnoses
- **Technologists document observations, not diagnoses**
- Describe what is seen
- Do not diagnose conditions
- Do not provide medical interpretations

### Key Principle
- **If it isn't documented, it didn't happen**
- Documentation is essential
- Undocumented findings don't exist
- Complete documentation protects all parties

### Practical Application
- Document all findings accurately
- Use objective, standardized language
- Stay within scope of practice
- Complete all required report elements

## 3. Objective Descriptive Language

### Use

#### "The EEG demonstrates…"
- **"The EEG demonstrates…"** (Objective description)
- Example: "The EEG demonstrates a well-organized 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm."
- Neutral, factual language
- Describes what is present

#### "There is evidence of…"
- **"There is evidence of…"** (Objective description)
- Example: "There is evidence of focal slowing over the left temporal region."
- Neutral, factual language
- Describes findings without interpretation

### Avoid

#### "This indicates epilepsy"
- **"This indicates epilepsy"** (Diagnostic statement - AVOID)
- This is a diagnosis, not a description
- Technologists do not diagnose
- Stay within scope of practice

#### "The patient has…"
- **"The patient has…"** (Diagnostic statement - AVOID)
- This implies diagnosis
- Technologists describe EEG, not patient conditions
- Use "The EEG shows..." instead

### ABRET Emphasis
- **Descriptive, neutral language is required**
- Use objective terminology
- Avoid diagnostic language
- Describe findings, not conditions

### Best Practice
- Use standardized terminology
- Describe what is seen
- Avoid interpretive language
- Stay within scope of practice

---

## 4. Scope of Practice

### Technologists

#### Describe EEG Findings
- **Describe EEG findings**
- Document what is observed
- Use objective language
- Report technical observations

#### Report Events
- **Report events**
- Document clinical events (seizures, behaviors)
- Document technical events (equipment issues)
- Document safety events

### Physicians

#### Interpret and Diagnose
- **Interpret and diagnose**
- Physicians interpret EEG findings
- Physicians make diagnoses
- Physicians correlate with clinical presentation

### ABRET Trap
- **Making diagnostic statements exceeds scope**
- Technologists do not diagnose
- Avoid diagnostic language
- Stay within scope of practice

### Best Practice
- Know your role and limitations
- Describe findings objectively
- Do not diagnose or interpret
- Refer diagnostic questions to physician

---

## 5. Documentation of Events

### Seizures
- **Seizures:** Document seizure events
- Time of onset
- Duration
- Description of activity
- Response taken

#### Documentation Must Include
- **Time:** Exact time of event
- **Description:** Detailed description of activity
- **Response:** Actions taken
- **Outcome:** Patient status after event

### Patient Behavior
- **Patient behavior:** Document significant behaviors
- Movements, responses
- State changes
- Clinical observations
- Relevant patient interactions

### Technical Interruptions
- **Technical interruptions:** Document technical issues
- Equipment problems
- Recording interruptions
- Artifact sources
- Resolution of issues

### Safety Events
- **Safety events:** Document safety-related events
- Adverse reactions
- Equipment malfunctions
- Patient distress
- Emergency responses

### Documentation Must Include

#### Time
- **Time:** Exact time of event
- Document when event occurred
- Include duration if applicable
- Note time relative to recording

#### Description
- **Description:** Detailed description
- What happened
- Where it occurred
- How it appeared
- Relevant details

#### Response Taken

## 7. Common ABRET Exam Traps

### Trap 1: Including Diagnostic Impressions
- **Reality:** Technologists do not diagnose
- **Trap:** May include diagnostic statements
- **Solution:** Describe findings, don't diagnose
- **ABRET focus:** Scope of practice boundaries

### Trap 2: Omitting Technical Parameters
- **Reality:** Technical parameters are required
- **Trap:** May omit filter, sensitivity, montage settings
- **Solution:** Document all technical parameters
- **ABRET focus:** Required report elements

### Trap 3: Vague or Subjective Language
- **Reality:** Objective, standardized language is required
- **Trap:** May use vague or subjective terms
- **Solution:** Use specific, objective terminology
- **ABRET focus:** Proper terminology

### Trap 4: Failure to Document Adverse Events
- **Reality:** All events must be documented
- **Trap:** May fail to document seizures, technical issues
- **Solution:** Document all significant events
- **ABRET focus:** Complete documentation

### Trap 5: Using Interpretive Language
- **Reality:** Descriptive language is required
- **Trap:** May use interpretive language
- **Solution:** Use objective, descriptive language
- **ABRET focus:** Objective reporting

## 8. Case-Based Example

### Scenario
**Clinical Setting:** Routine EEG for seizure evaluation  
**EEG Finding:** Focal sharp waves over left temporal region  
**Documentation Task:** Write appropriate technical description

### Correct Documentation
- **"Focal sharp transients were observed over the left temporal region."**
- Objective description
- No diagnostic language
- Specific location
- Appropriate terminology

### Teaching Point
- **Description without diagnosis is required**
- Describe what is seen
- Avoid diagnostic statements
- Use objective language
- Stay within scope of practice

### ABRET Application
- Given EEG finding → describe objectively
- Given diagnostic statement → recognize as outside scope
- Given vague language → use specific terminology
- Must know required report elements
