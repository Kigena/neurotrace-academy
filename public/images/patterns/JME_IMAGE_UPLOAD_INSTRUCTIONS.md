# JME Image Upload Instructions

## Image File Name

**Save your JME image as:**
```
jme-polyspike-wave.png
```

## Exact File Path

**Full path:**
```
public/images/patterns/jme-polyspike-wave.png
```

**Relative path (from project root):**
```
public/images/patterns/jme-polyspike-wave.png
```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Prepare your image:**
   - Format: PNG (preferred) or JPG
   - Size: 1200-2000px width recommended
   - File size: Keep under 2MB
   - Content: Should show polyspike-and-wave pattern characteristic of JME

2. **Save the file:**
   - Navigate to: `public/images/patterns/`
   - Save as: `jme-polyspike-wave.png` (exact name, case-sensitive)

3. **Verify the file exists:**
   - Check: `public/images/patterns/jme-polyspike-wave.png`
   - The file should be in the same folder as other pattern images

4. **Refresh your browser:**
   - Visit: `http://localhost:5002/syndromes/jme`
   - Go to "EEG Morphology" tab
   - The image should appear automatically!

## What the Image Should Show

**Ideal JME Image Content:**
- **Polyspike-and-wave pattern** (multiple spikes followed by slow wave)
- Generalized, symmetric, synchronous distribution
- Normal background (characteristic of IGE)
- May show pattern during:
  - Awakening from sleep (most characteristic)
  - Sleep deprivation
  - Photic stimulation (if photosensitive)
  - Interictal state

**Key Features to Include:**
- Multiple spikes (2-5+) followed by slow wave
- Generalized distribution (all channels)
- High amplitude (200-500 µV)
- Brief duration (1-3 seconds for myoclonus)

## Image Display

Once uploaded, the image will:
- ✅ Display on `/syndromes/jme` page
- ✅ Show in "EEG Morphology" tab
- ✅ Appear with caption: "Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME) - EEG Morphology"
- ✅ Be responsive (scales to screen size)
- ✅ Have error handling (won't break if missing)

## Verification

After uploading, verify:
1. File exists at: `public/images/patterns/jme-polyspike-wave.png`
2. File is readable (not corrupted)
3. Image displays on JME detail page
4. Image shows polyspike-and-wave pattern clearly

## Troubleshooting

**Image not showing?**
- Check file name is EXACTLY: `jme-polyspike-wave.png` (case-sensitive)
- Check file is in correct location: `public/images/patterns/`
- Clear browser cache and refresh
- Check browser console for errors

**Wrong image?**
- Make sure it shows polyspike-and-wave (multiple spikes), not single spike-and-wave
- Should be generalized (all channels), not focal
- Should have normal background (characteristic of IGE)

## Quick Reference

```
File Name: jme-polyspike-wave.png
Location: public/images/patterns/
URL: /images/patterns/jme-polyspike-wave.png
Display: /syndromes/jme → "EEG Morphology" tab
```
