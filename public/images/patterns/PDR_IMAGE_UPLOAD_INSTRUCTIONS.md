# PDR (Posterior Dominant Rhythm) Image Upload Instructions

## Image File Name

**Save your PDR image as:**
```
pdr.png
```

## Exact File Path

**Full path:**
```
public/images/patterns/pdr.png
```

**Relative path (from project root):**
```
public/images/patterns/pdr.png
```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Prepare your image:**
   - Format: PNG (preferred) or JPG
   - Size: 1200-2000px width recommended
   - File size: Keep under 2MB
   - Content: Should show posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) pattern

2. **Save the file:**
   - Navigate to: `public/images/patterns/`
   - Save as: `pdr.png` (exact name, case-sensitive)

3. **Verify the file exists:**
   - Check: `public/images/patterns/pdr.png`
   - The file should be in the same folder as other pattern images

4. **Refresh your browser:**
   - Visit: `http://localhost:5002/patterns/pattern_pdr`
   - Go to "Core Identity" or "ABRET Pearls" tab
   - The image should appear automatically!

## What the Image Should Show

**Ideal PDR Image Content:**
- **Posterior Dominant Rhythm (PDR)** - 8-13 Hz rhythm
- **Posterior maximum** (occipital region - O1, O2, Oz)
- **Sinusoidal, symmetric rhythm**
- **Reactive to eye opening** (attenuates when eyes open)
- May show:
  - Eyes closed state (PDR present)
  - Eyes open state (PDR attenuated) - for comparison
  - Age-appropriate frequency (8-13 Hz in adults)

**Key Features to Include:**
- Posterior location (occipital electrodes)
- 8-13 Hz frequency (age-dependent)
- Symmetric distribution
- Reactivity demonstration (eyes closed vs. eyes open)
- Normal background

## Image Display

Once uploaded, the image will:
- ✅ Display on `/patterns/pattern_pdr` page
- ✅ Show in "Core Identity" tab
- ✅ Also appear in "ABRET Pearls" tab
- ✅ Appear with caption: "Posterior Dominant Rhythm (PDR) - EEG Example"
- ✅ Be responsive (scales to screen size)
- ✅ Have error handling (won't break if missing)

## Verification

After uploading, verify:
1. File exists at: `public/images/patterns/pdr.png`
2. File is readable (not corrupted)
3. Image displays on PDR pattern detail page
4. Image shows PDR pattern clearly:
   - Posterior location
   - 8-13 Hz frequency
   - Symmetric rhythm

## Troubleshooting

**Image not showing?**
- Check file name is EXACTLY: `pdr.png` (case-sensitive)
- Check file is in correct location: `public/images/patterns/`
- Clear browser cache and refresh
- Check browser console for errors

**Wrong image?**
- Make sure it shows PDR (8-13 Hz posterior rhythm), not OIRDA (1-3 Hz)
- Should be posterior (occipital), not central or frontal
- Should show reactivity (attenuates with eye opening)

## Key Distinctions

**PDR vs Other Patterns:**
- **PDR:** 8-13 Hz, posterior, reactive to eye opening → `pdr.png`
- **OIRDA:** 1-3 Hz, posterior, intermittent, not reactive → Different pattern
- **Drowsy Slowing:** Theta/delta, posterior, state-dependent → Different pattern
- **Fast Alpha Variant:** 16-26 Hz, posterior, harmonic of PDR → Different pattern

## Quick Reference

```
File Name: pdr.png
Location: public/images/patterns/
URL: /images/patterns/pdr.png
Display: /patterns/pattern_pdr → "Core Identity" or "ABRET Pearls" tab
Pattern ID: pattern_pdr
```

## Additional Notes

- PDR is the most fundamental normal EEG rhythm
- Frequency is age-dependent (slower in children, may slow in elderly)
- Reactivity to eye opening is CRITICAL for identification
- Absent or poorly reactive PDR may be significant depending on context
